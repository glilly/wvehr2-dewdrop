 ;;D.  Diagnostic Tests:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Provide psychological testing if deemed necessary.
 ;;    2.  If testing is requested, the results must be reported and 
 ;;        considered in arriving at the diagnosis.
 ;;    3.  Provide any specific evaluation information required by the 
 ;;        rating board or on BVA Remand (in claims folder).
 ;;
 ;;        a.  COMPETENCY:  State whether the veteran is capable of 
 ;;            managing his/her benefit payments in the individual's own
 ;;            best interests (a physical disability which prevents the 
 ;;            veteran from attending to financial matters in person is 
 ;;            not a proper basis for a finding of incompetency unless 
 ;;            the veteran is, by reason of that disability, incapable of
 ;;            directing someone else in handling the individual's 
 ;;            financial affairs).
 ;;
 ;;        b.  OTHER OPINION:  Furnish any other specific opinion requested 
 ;;            by the rating board or BVA Remand furnishing the complete
 ;;            rationale and citation of medical texts or treatise 
 ;;            supporting opinion, if medical literature review was under-
 ;;            taken. If the requested opinion is medically not ascertainable 
 ;;            on exam or testing, please indicate why.  If the requested
 ;;            opinion can not be expressed without resorting to 
 ;;            speculation or making improbable assumptions say so, and 
 ;;            explain why.  If the opinion asks "...is it at least as 
 ;;            likely as not..?", fully explain the clinical findings and
 ;;            rationale for the opinion.
 ;;
 ;;    4.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted
 ;;        in the examination report.
 ;;
 ;;TOF
 ;;E.  Diagnosis: 
 ;;
 ;;    Provide:
 ;;    1.  The Diagnosis must conform to DSM-IV and be supported by the 
 ;;        findings on the examination report.
 ;;    2.  If the diagnosis is changed, explain fully whether the new 
 ;;        diagnosis represents a progression of the prior diagnosis or 
 ;;        development of a new and separate condition.
 ;;    3.  If there are multiple mental disorders, delineate to the
 ;;        extent possible the symptoms associated with each and a 
 ;;        discussion of relationship.
 ;;    4.  Evaluation is based on the effects of the signs and symptoms 
 ;;        on occupational and social functioning.
 ;;
 ;;NOTE:  VA is prohibited by statute from paying compensation for a 
 ;;disability that is a result of the veteran's own ALCOHOL OR DRUG ABUSE, 
 ;;whether based on direct service connection, secondary service connection, 
 ;;or aggravation by a service-connected condition.  Therefore, when 
 ;;alcohol or drug abuse accompanies or is associated with another mental
 ;;disorder, separate, to the extent possible, the effects of the alcohol
 ;;or drug abuse from the effects of the other mental disorder(s).  If it
 ;;is not possible to separate the effects, explain why.
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;F.  Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF):
 ;;
 ;;NOTE:  The complete multi-axial format as specified by DSM-IV may 
 ;;be required by BVA REMAND or specifically requested by the rating 
 ;;specialist.  If so, include the GAF score and note whether it 
 ;;refers to current functioning over the past year, etc.
 ;;
 ;;If multiple Axis or Axis II diagnoses exist, attempt, to the extent 
 ;;possible, to provide a GAF score for the service connected conditions
 ;;alone as well as a separate overall GAF score based on all mental 
 ;;disorders present and explain and discuss the rationale.  (See the 
 ;;above note pertaining to alcohol or drug abuse, effects of which cannot 
 ;;be used to assess the effects of a service-connected condition.)  If 
 ;;unable to separate symptomatology, explain why.

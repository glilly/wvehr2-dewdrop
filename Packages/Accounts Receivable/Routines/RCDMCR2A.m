RCDMCR2A        ;HEC/SBW - DMC Debt Validity Management Report ;9/Oct/2007
        ;;4.5;Accounts Receivable;**253**;Mar 20, 1995;Build 9
        ;;Per VHA Directive 2004-038, this routine should not be modified.
        ;
        ;This routine is being implemented for the Hold Debt to DMC Project.
        ;It will do the following:
        ;   A new management report option will be added in AR to assist
        ;   managers in reviewing the processing of the bills related to
        ;   the Debt Validity Report. This report will include bills
        ;   for veterans who are SC 50% to 100% or in receipt of VA Pension
        ;   benefits and have bills for episodes of care within the previous
        ;   365 days (or older selected date). The user will have the option to
        ;   select if the report will be for bills where the DMC Debt Valid
        ;   field is "null", "PENDING", "YES", "NO" or All Values. The report
        ;   will list only bills with Current Status of "ACTIVE", "OPEN",
        ;   "SUSPENDED", "CANCELLATION", "REFUND REVIEW" and "REFUNDED".

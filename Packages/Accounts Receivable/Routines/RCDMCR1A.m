        ;;Per VHA Directive 2004-038, this routine should not be modified.
        ;
        ;This routine is being implemented for the Hold Debt to DMC Project.
        ;It will do the following:
        ;   Report option in AR to assist users in focusing on reviewing the
        ;   legitimacy of bills for veterans who are SC 50% to 100% or in
        ;   receipt of VA Pension benefits. The report contains information
        ;   on veterans who meet the above criteria and have bills for episodes
        ;   of care within the previous 365 days (or older selected date) with
        ;   a DMC Debt Valid field not flagged as 'YES' or 'NO'. Authorized
        ;   billing staff can run the report to ensure that all bills meeting
        ;   the above criteria are  reviewed and if necessary the appropriate
        ;   action is taken as follows:
        ;        Bill is appropriate - Update the Debt Validity Status field to
        ;            'YES' in order that the bill is referred to DMC via the
        ;            automated process if all other DMC criteria is met
        ;        Bill is inappropriate - Update the Debt Validity Status Field
        ;            to 'NO' and staff will cancel the bill using existing
        ;            functionality
        ;        Inappropriate bill sent to DMC - Staff to initiate action to
        ;            cancel DMC collection or refund payments using existing
        ;            functionality

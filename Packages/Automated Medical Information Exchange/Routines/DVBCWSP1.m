        ;;       curvatures of the spine, symmetry in appearance.
        ;;
        ;;   2.  Range of motion
        ;;
        ;;       a.  Cervical Spine 
        ;;
        ;;           The reproducibility of an individual's range of motion is one
        ;;           indicator of optimum effort. Pain, fear of injury, disuse or
        ;;           neuromuscular inhibition may limit mobility by decreasing the
        ;;           individual's effort. If range of motion measurements fail to
        ;;           match known pathology, please repeat the measurements.
        ;;           (Reference: Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment,
        ;;           Fifth Edition, 2001, page 399).
        ;;
        ;;           i. Using a goniometer, measure and report the range of motion in
        ;;              degrees of forward flexion, extension, left lateral flexion,
        ;;              right lateral flexion, left lateral rotation and right lateral
        ;;              rotation. Generally, the normal ranges of motion for the
        ;;              cervical spine are as follows:
        ;;
        ;;              -Forward flexion: 0 to 45 degrees 
        ;;              -Extension: 0 to 45 degrees 
        ;;              -Left Lateral Flexion: 0 to 45 degrees 
        ;;              -Right Lateral Flexion: 0 to 45 degrees 
        ;;              -Left Lateral Rotation: 0 to 80 degrees 
        ;;              -Right Lateral Rotation: 0 to 80 degrees
        ;;
        ;;           There may be a situation where an individual's range of motion is
        ;;           reduced, but "normal" (in the examiner's opinion) based on the
        ;;           individual's age, body habitus, neurologic disease, or other
        ;;           factors unrelated to the disability for which the exam is being
        ;;           performed. In this situation, please explain why the individual's
        ;;           measured range of motion should be considered as "normal".
        ;;
        ;;           
        ;;          ii. Describe presence or absence of objective evidence of pain.
        ;;
        ;;         iii. Describe objective evidence of painful motion, spasm, weakness,
        ;;              tenderness, atrophy, guarding, etc.
        ;; 
        ;;          iv. Describe any postural abnormalities, fixed deformity
        ;;              (ankylosis), or abnormality of musculature of cervical spine
        ;;              musculature.
        ;;
        ;;       b. Thoracolumbar spine 
        ;;
        ;;          The reproducibility of an individual's range of motion is one
        ;;          indicator of optimum effort. Pain, fear of injury, disuse or
        ;;          neuromuscular inhibition may limit mobility by decreasing the
        ;;          individual's effort. If range of motion measurements fail to
        ;;          match known pathology, please repeat the measurements.
        ;;          (Reference: Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment,
        ;;          Fifth Edition, 2001, page 399).
        ;; 
        ;;          It is best to measure range of motion for the thoracolumbar
        ;;          spine from a standing position. Measuring the range of motion
        ;;          from a standing position (as opposed to from a sitting position)
        ;;          will include the effects of forces generated by the distance
        ;;          from the center of gravity from the axis of motion of the spine
        ;;          and will include the effect of contraction of the spinal
        ;;          muscles. Contraction of the spinal muscles imposes a significant
        ;;          compressive force during spine movements upon the lumbar discs.
        ;;
        ;;          i. Provide forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine as a unit.
        ;;             Do not include hip flexion. (See Magee, Orthopedic Physical
        ;;             Assessment, Third Edition, 1997, W.B. Saunders Company,
        ;;             pages 374-75). Using a goniometer, measure and report the range
        ;;             of motion in degrees for forward flexion, extension, left 
        ;;             lateral flexion, right lateral flexion, left lateral rotation
        ;;             and right lateral rotation. Generally, the normal ranges of 
        ;;             motion for the thoracolumbar spine as a unit are as follows:
        ;;
        ;;             -Forward flexion: 0 to 90 degrees 
        ;;             -Extension: 0 to 30 degrees 
        ;;             -Left Lateral Flexion: 0 to 30 degrees 
        ;;             -Right Lateral Flexion: 0 to 30 degrees 
        ;;             -Left Lateral Rotation: 0 to 30 degrees 
        ;;             -Right Lateral Rotation: 0 to 30 degrees
        ;;
        ;;           There may be a situation where an individual's range of motion is
        ;;           reduced, but "normal" (in the examiner's opinion) based on the
        ;;           individual's age, body habitus, neurologic disease, or other
        ;;           factors unrelated to the disability for which the exam is being
        ;;           performed. In this situation, please explain why the individual's
        ;;           measured range of motion should be considered as "normal".
        ;;
        ;;
        ;;          ii. Describe presence or absence of objective evidence of pain.
        ;;
        ;;         iii. Describe objective evidence of painful motion, spasm, weakness,
        ;;              tenderness, atrophy, guarding, etc.
        ;;
        ;;
        ;;              a. Indicate whether there is muscle spasm, guarding or localized
        ;;                 tenderness with preserved spinal contour, and normal gait.
        ;;
        ;;              b. Indicate whether there is muscle spasm, or guarding severe
        ;;                 enough to result in an abnormal gait, abnormal spinal contour
        ;;                 such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis or abnormal kyphosis.
        ;;
        ;;          iv. Describe any postural abnormalities, fixed deformity (ankylosis), 
        ;;                  or abnormality of musculature of back.

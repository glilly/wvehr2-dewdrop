DIWP ;;;
 ;;; D I W P     Word Processing
 ;;;
 ;;; 1. ENTRY POINT: ^DIWP
 ;;;    Before calling DIWP, kill global ^UTILITY($J,"W"). Then DIWP is invoked
 ;;;    for each text line.
 ;;;
 ;;; 2. INPUT VARIABLES
 ;;;    X.......The string of text to be added as input to the formatter. X may
 ;;;            contain |-windows. The expressions within the windows will be
 ;;;            processed as long as they DO NOT refer to database field names.
 ;;;            Thus, |TODAY| will cause today's date to be inserted into the
 ;;;            formatted text.
 ;;;    DIWL....Left margin.
 ;;;    DIWR....Right margin
 ;;;    DIWF....A string of format control parameters:
 ;;;            W = The formatted text will be written out to the current device,
 ;;;                and will not be stored in ^UTILITY($J,"W").
 ;;;            B = Followed by integer, n. The text will stop printing n lines
 ;;;                from the bottom of the page.
 ;;;            C = Followed by integer, n. Column width. Overrides DIWR.
 ;;;            D = Double spaced.
 ;;;            I = Followed by integer, n. Indent n col from left margin (DIWL).
 ;;;            N = No-wrap. If DIWF contains N, DIWR will be ignored.
 ;;;            R = Right justified.

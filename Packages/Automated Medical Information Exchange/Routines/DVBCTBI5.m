        ;;Narrative: The potential residuals of traumatic brain injury necessitate a
        ;;comprehensive examination to document all disabling effects.  Specialist
        ;;examinations, such as eye and audio examinations, mental disorder
        ;;examinations, and others, may also be needed in some cases, as indicated
        ;;below.  If possible, conduct a thorough review of the service and post-service
        ;;medical records prior to the examination.
        ;;
        ;;Health care providers who may conduct TBI examinations:
        ;;Physicians who are specialists in Physiatry, Neurology, Neurosurgery, and
        ;;Psychiatry and who have training and experience with Traumatic Brain Injury
        ;;may conduct TBI examinations.  The expectation is that the physician would
        ;;have demonstrated expertise, regardless of specialty, through baseline training
        ;;(residency) and/or subsequent training and demonstrated experience.  In
        ;;addition, a nurse practitioner, a clinical nurse specialist, or a physician
        ;;assistant, if they are clinically privileged to perform activities required
        ;;for C&P TBI examinations, and have evidence of expertise through training
        ;;and demonstrated experience, may conduct TBI examinations under close
        ;;supervision of a board-certified or board-eligible physiatrist, neurologist,
        ;;or psychiatrist.
        ;;
        ;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
        ;;
        ;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
        ;;
        ;;    1. Report date(s) and nature of injury.
        ;;    2. State severity rating of traumatic brain injury (TBI) at time of injury.
        ;;    3. State whether condition has stabilized.  If not, provide estimate of
        ;;       when stability may be expected (typically within 18-24 months of initial
        ;;       injury).
        ;;    4. Inquire specifically about each symptom or area of symptoms below,
        ;;       since individuals with TBI may have difficulty organizing and
        ;;       communicating their symptoms without prompting.  It is important to
        ;;       document all problems, whether subtle or pronounced, so that the
        ;;       veteran can be appropriately evaluated for all disabilities due to
        ;;       TBI.
        ;;

        ;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
        ;;    Address each of the following and fully describe current findings:
        ;;
        ;;    1. Motor function.  Report the motor strength of the affected muscles of
        ;;       all areas of weakness or paralysis using the standard muscle grading
        ;;       scale, for example, weakness of flexion of left elbow (3/5 strength
        ;;       for flexors), complete paralysis of left lower extremity (0/5 for all
        ;;       muscle groups).  To the extent possible, identify the peripheral
        ;;       nerves that innervate the weakened or paralyzed muscles, even when
        ;;       the weakness or paralysis is of central origin.
        ;;
        ;;       Standard muscle grading scale:
        ;;
        ;;       0 = Absent  No muscle movement felt.
        ;;       1 = Trace  Muscle can be felt to tighten, but no movement produced.
        ;;       2 = Poor  Muscle movement produced only with gravity eliminated.
        ;;       3 = Fair  Muscle movement produced against gravity, but cannot
        ;;           overcome any resistance.
        ;;       4 = Good  Muscle movement produced against some resistance, but not
        ;;           against "normal" resistance.
        ;;       5 = Normal  Muscle movement can overcome "normal" resistance.
        ;;
        ;;    2. Muscle tone, reflexes.  Describe any muscle atrophy or loss of muscle
        ;;       tone.  Examine and report deep tendon reflexes and any pathological
        ;;       reflexes.
        ;;    3. Sensory function.  Describe exact location of any area of abnormal
        ;;       sensory function.  State which modalities of sensation were tested.
        ;;       Identify the peripheral nerve(s) that innervate the areas with
        ;;       abnormal sensation.
        ;;    4. Gait, spasticity, cerebellar signs.  Describe any gait abnormality,
        ;;       imbalance, tremor or fasciculations, incoordination, or spasticity.
        ;;       If there is spasticity or rigidity, assess any limitation of motion
        ;;       of joint (including joint contracture) by following the Joints
        ;;       examination protocol.  (A tandem gait assessment (walking in a
        ;;       straight line with one foot directly in front of the other) is
        ;;       recommended).
        ;;    5. Autonomic nervous system.  Describe any other impairment of the
        ;;       autonomic nervous system, such as orthostatic (postural) hypotension
        ;;       (if present, state if associated with dizziness or syncope on
        ;;       standing), hyperhidrosis, delayed gastric emptying, heat intolerance,
        ;;       etc.
        ;;    6. Cranial nerves.  Conduct a screening exam for cranial nerve impairment.
        ;;       If positive, follow Cranial Nerve examination protocol.
        ;;    7. Cognitive impairment.  Conduct a screening examination (such as the
        ;;       Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) or Mini-Mental State Examination
        ;;       (MMSE) to assess cognitive impairment and report results and their
        ;;       significance.  Does the screening show problems with memory,
        ;;       concentration, attention, executive functions, etc.?  If yes,
        ;;       neuropsychological testing to confirm the presence and extent of
        ;;       cognitive impairment is needed, unless already conducted and of
        ;;       record.  Include test results in the examination report.
        ;;    8. Psychiatric manifestations.  Conduct a screening examination for
        ;;       psychiatric manifestations, including neurobehavioral effects.  If a
        ;;       mental disorder is suggested, request a mental disorder exam or
        ;;       PTSD exam, as appropriate, by a mental disease specialist.
        ;;    9. Vision and hearing screening examinations (if abnormalities are
        ;;       found, or there are symptoms or a claim of eye or ear impairment,
        ;;       request an eye or audio exam by a specialist).
        ;;   10. Skin.  Describe any areas of skin breakdown due to neurologic problems.

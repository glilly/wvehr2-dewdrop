 ;;      request remarks for specifics.):
 ;; 
 ;;           a. CAPACITY TO MANAGE FINANCIAL AFFAIRS Mental competency, for
 ;;              VA benefits purposes, refers only to the ability of the
 ;;              veteran to manage VA benefit payments in his or her own best
 ;;              interest, and not to any other subject.  Mental incompetency,
 ;;              for VA benefits purposes, means that the veteran, because
 ;;              of injury or disease, is not capable of managing benefit
 ;;              payments in his or her best interest.  In order to assist
 ;;              raters in making a legal determination as to competency,
 ;;              please address the following:
 ;;              - What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability
 ;;                to manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration
 ;;                of such things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit
 ;;                payment, knowing the amounts and types of bills owed monthly,
 ;;                and handling the payment prudently? Does the veteran handle
 ;;                the money and pay the bills?
 ;;
 ;;              - Based on your examination, do you believe that the veteran is
 ;;                capable of managing his or her financial affairs?
 ;;                Please provide examples to support your conclusion.
 ;;
 ;;              - If you believe a Social Work Service assessment is needed before
 ;;                you can give your opinion on the veteran's ability to manage his
 ;;                or her financial affairs, please explain why.
 ;;
 ;;      b.  OTHER OPINION: Furnish any other specific opinion requested
 ;;          by the rating board or BVA Remand, furnishing the complete 
 ;;          rationale and citation of medical texts or treatise supporting 
 ;;          opinion, if medical literature review was undertaken. If the
 ;;          requested opinion is medically not ascertainable on exam or
 ;;          testing, please state WHY. If the requested opinion cannot be
 ;;          expressed without resorting to speculation or making improbable
 ;;          assumptions say so, and explain why. If the opinion asks "...is
 ;;          it at least as likely as not...", fully explain the clinical
 ;;          findings and rationale for the opinion.
 ;;
 ;;  2.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted 
 ;;      in the examination report.

 ;;Include your name; your credentials, (i.e., board certified psychiatrist,

 ;;LCSW, or NP); and circumstances under which you performed the examination,
 ;;if applicable (i.e., under the close supervision of an attending
 ;;psychiatrist or psychologist); name of supervising psychiatrist or
 ;;psychologist, if applicable.

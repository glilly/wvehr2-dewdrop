 ;;
 ;;D.  Diagnostic Tests:
 ;;
 ;;     1. Provide psychological testing if deemed necessary.
 ;;     2. If testing is requested, the results must be reported and considered in
 ;;        arriving at the diagnosis.
 ;;     3. Provide any specific evaluation information required by the rating board
 ;;        or on BVA Remand (in claims folder).
 ;;
 ;;           a. COMPETENCY:  State whether the veteran is capable of managing
 ;;              his/her benefit payments in the individual's own best interests
 ;;              (a physical disability which prevents the veteran from attending
 ;;              to financial matters in person is not a proper basis for a finding
 ;;              of incompetency unless the veteran is, by reason of that
 ;;              disability, incapable of directing someone else in handling
 ;;              the individual's financial affairs).
 ;;
 ;;           b. OTHER OPINION: Furnish any other specific opinion requested 
 ;;              by the rating board or BVA Remand furnishing the complete
 ;;              rationale and citation of medical texts or treatise supporting
 ;;              opinion, if medical literature review was undertaken.
 ;;              If the requested opinion is medically not ascertainable on exam
 ;;              or testing, please indicate WHY. If the requested opinion can not
 ;;              be expressed without resorting to speculation or making improbable
 ;;              assumptions say so, and explain why. If the opinion asks "...is it
 ;;              at least as likely as not..?", fully explain the clinical findings
 ;;              and rationale for the opinion.
 ;;     4. Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted
 ;;        in the examination report.
 ;;TOF
 ;;E. Diagnosis: 
 ;;    Provide:
 ;;
 ;;    1. The Diagnosis must conform to DSM-IV and be supported by the findings
 ;;       on the examination report.
 ;;    2. If the diagnosis is changed, explain fully whether the new diagnosis
 ;;       represents a progression of the prior diagnosis or development of a new
 ;;       and separate condition.
 ;;    3. If there are multiple mental disorders, delineate to the extent possible
 ;;       the symptoms associated with each and a discussion of relationship.
 ;;    4. Evaluation is based on the effects of the signs and symptoms on
 ;;       occupational and social functioning.
 ;;
 ;;NOTE:  VA is prohibited by statute, 38 U.S.C. 1110, from paying compensation
 ;;for a disability that is a result of the veteran's own ALCOHOL OR DRUG ABUSE.
 ;;However, when a veteran's alcohol or drug abuse disability is secondary to
 ;;or is caused or aggravated by a primary service-connected disorder, the  
 ;;veteran may be entitled to compensation.  See Allen v. Principi, 237 F.3d
 ;;1368, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  Therefore, it is important to determine the
 ;;relationship, if any, between a service-connected disorder and a disability
 ;;resulting from the veteran's alcohol or drug abuse.  Unless alcohol or drug
 ;;abuse is secondary to or is caused or aggravated by another mental disorder,
 ;;you should separate, to the extent possible, the effects of the alcohol or
 ;;drug abuse from the effects of the other mental disorder(s).  If it is not
 ;;possible to separate the effects in such cases, please explain why.
 ;;
 ;;F. Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF):
 ;;
 ;;NOTE:  The complete multi-axial format as specified by DSM-IV may be required
 ;;by BVA REMAND or specifically requested by the rating specialist. If so,
 ;;include the GAF score and note whether it refers to current functioning.
 ;;A BVA REMAND may also request, in addition to an overall GAF score, that a
 ;;separate GAF score be provided for each mental disorder present when there are
 ;;multiple Axis I or Axis II diagnoses and not all are service-connected.
 ;;If separate GAF scores can be given, an explanation and discussion of 
 ;;the rationale is needed. If it is not possible, an explanation as to why not is
 ;;needed. (See the above note pertaining to alcohol or drug abuse.)

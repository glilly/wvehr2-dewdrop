        ;;Per VHA Directive 2004-038, this routine should not be modified.
        ;---------------------------------------------------------------
        ; IHS/SD/lwj  9/3/02  NCPDP 5.1 changes
        ; In 3.2, prior authorization was updated and stored in field 416.
        ; In 5.1, 416 is obsolete, and the information could be stored
        ; in field 461, and 462 or in the prior authorization segment.
        ; For now, the insurer/processors appear to be using 461, and
        ; 462 rather than the segment.  In any case, we needed to change
        ; the way we capture prior authorization information - AND - we
        ; have to keep populating 416 since we have to still process 3.2
        ; claims.  This routine was changed to call PRIORA in BPSOSo2
        ; rather than EDIT^BPSOSO2 when we are processing a prior auth.
        ;(Field prompts also altered to match 5.1 standards.)

        ;;NARRATIVE:  This is a comprehensive base-line or screening examination for 
        ;;all body systems, not just specific conditions claimed by the veteran.
        ;;It is often the initial post-discharge examination of a veteran requested
        ;;by the Compensation and Pension Service for disability compensation
        ;;purposes.  As a screening examination, it is not meant to elicit the
        ;;detailed information about specific conditions that is necessary for rating
        ;;purposes.  Therefore, all claimed conditions, and any found or suspected
        ;;conditions that were not claimed, should be addressed by referring to
        ;;and following all appropriate worksheets, in addition to this one, to 
        ;;assure that the examination for each condition provides information
        ;;adequate for rating purposes.  This does not require that a medical
        ;;specialist conduct examinations based on other worksheets, except in the
        ;;case of vision and hearing problems, mental disorders, or especially
        ;;complex or unusual problems.  VISION, HEARING, AND MENTAL DISORDER
        ;;EXAMINATIONS MUST BE CONDUCTED BY A SPECIALIST.  The examiner may request
        ;;any additional studies or examinations needed for proper diagnosis and
        ;;evaluation (see other worksheets for guidance).  All important negatives
        ;;should be reported.  The regional office may also request a general medical
        ;;examination as evidence for nonservice-connected disability pension claims
        ;;or for claimed entitlement to individual unemployability benefits in
        ;;service-connected disability compensation claims.  Barring unusual
        ;;problems, examinations for pension should generally be adequate if only
        ;;this general worksheet is followed.
        ;;
        ;;
        ;;A.  REVIEW OF MEDICAL RECORDS:  Indicate whether the C-file was reviewed.
        ;;
        ;;
        ;;B.  MEDICAL HISTORY (Subjective Complaints):
        ;;
        ;;    1.  Discuss:  Whether an injury or disease that is found OCCURRED 
        ;;        DURING ACTIVE SERVICE, BEFORE ACTIVE SERVICE, OR AFTER ACTIVE 
        ;;        SERVICE.  To the extent possible, describe the circumstances,
        ;;        dates, specific injury or disease that occurred, treatment,
        ;;        follow-up, and residuals.  If the injury or disease occurred
        ;;        BEFORE ACTIVE SERVICE, describe any worsening of residuals due
        ;;        to being in military service.  Describe current symptoms.
        ;;
        ;;    2.  If there are flareups of any joint (including of spine, hands, and
        ;;        feet) or muscle disease, state the frequency, duration,
        ;;        precipitating factors, alleviating factors, and the extent, if
        ;;        any, per veteran, they result in additional limitation of motion
        ;;        or other functional impairment during the flareup.
        ;;
        ;;    3.  Describe details of current treatment, conditions being treated,
        ;;        and side effects of treatment.
        ;;
        ;;    4.  Describe all surgery and hospitalizations in and after service
        ;;        with approximate dates.
        ;;
        ;;    5.  If a neoplasm is or was present, state whether benign or malignant
        ;;        and provide:
        ;;        a.  Exact diagnosis and date of confirmed diagnosis.
        ;;        b.  Location of neoplasm.
        ;;        c.  Types and dates of treatment.
        ;;        d.  For malignant neoplasm, also state exact date of the last
        ;;            surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy, radiation, or
        ;;            other therapeutic procedure.
        ;;        e.  If treatment is already completed, provide date of last treat-
        ;;             ment, and fully describe residuals.  If not completed, state
        ;;              expected date of completion.
        ;;
        ;;
        ;;C.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION (Objective Findings):
        ;;
        ;;    Address each of the following and fully describe current findings:
        ;;    The examiner should incorporate results of all ancillary studies
        ;;    into the final diagnoses.

        ;;        Describe any ambulatory aids and name the condition requiring the
        ;;        ambulatory aid(s).
        ;;
        ;;    4.  SKIN, INCLUDING APPENDAGES:  If abnormal, describe appearance, 
        ;;        location, extent of lesions.  If there are laceration or burn

        ;;        shape, depression, type of tissue loss, adherence, and tenderness.
        ;;        See the Scars worksheet for furthur guidance.  Describe any
        ;;        limitation of activity or limitation of motion due to scarring or
        ;;        other skin lesions.  NOTE:  If there are disfiguring scars (of face,

        ;;        can climb.  If a respiratory condition is claimed or suspected,
        ;;        refer to appropriate worksheet(s).  Most respiratory conditions
        ;;        will require PFT's, including post-bronchodilation studies.
        ;;
        ;;   12.  BREAST:  Describe masses, scars, nipple discharge, skin
        ;;        abnormalities.  Give date of last mammogram, if any.  Describe

        ;;            and venous disease.  Give NYHA classification of heart disease. 
        ;;            A determination of METS by exercise testing may be required
        ;;            for certain cardiovascular conditions, and an estimation of
        ;;            METS may be required if exercise testing cannot be conducted
        ;;            for medical reasons.  Report heart size and how determined.
        ;;            (See the cardiovascular worksheets for further guidance.)
        ;;
        ;;        b.  Describe the status of peripheral vessels and pulses.
        ;;            Describe edema, stasis pigmentation or eczema, ulcers, or
        ;;            other skin or nail abnormalities.  Describe varicose veins,

        ;;            by elevation of extremity.  Examine for evidence of residuals
        ;;            of cold injury when indicated.  See and follow special cold
        ;;            injury examination worksheet if there is a history of cold
        ;;            exposure in service and the special cold injury examination
        ;;            has not been previously done.
        ;;
        ;;        c.  BLOOD PRESSURE:  (Per the rating schedule, hypertension means
        ;;            that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90 mm.
        ;;            or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that
        ;;            the systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160 mm. or
        ;;            greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm.)
        ;;
        ;;            i.  If the diagnosis of hypertension has not been previously
        ;;                established, and it is a claimed issue, B.P. readings
        ;;                MUST be taken two or more times on each of at least 
        ;;                three different days.
        ;;           ii.  If hypertension has been previously diagnosed and is
        ;;                claimed, but the claimant is not on treatment, B.P. 
        ;;                readings MUST be taken two or more times on each of
        ;;                at least three different days.
        ;;          iii.  If hypertension has been previously diagnosed, and the
        ;;                claimant is on treatment, take three blood pressure 
        ;;                readings on the day of the examination.

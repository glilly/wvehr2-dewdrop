        ;;Narrative:  The potential residuals of traumatic brain injury necessitate
        ;;a comprehensive examination to document all disabling effects.  Specialist
        ;;examinations, such as eye and audio examinations, mental disorder
        ;;examinations, and others, may also be needed in some cases, as indicated
        ;;below.  If possible, conduct a thorough review of the service and post-

        ;;Narrative:  An eye examination must be conducted by a licensed optometrist
        ;;or ophthalmologist.  Examinations for the evaluation of visual fields or
        ;;muscle function will be conducted only when there is a medical indication
        ;;of disease or injury that may be associated with visual field defect or
        ;;impaired muscle function.  Unless medically contraindicated, the fundus must
        ;;be examined with the claimant's pupils dilated.  The examiner must identify
        ;;the disease, injury, or other pathologic process responsible for any visual
        ;;impairment found.
        ;;
        ;;
        ;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
        ;;
        ;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
        ;;
        ;;    Comment on:
        ;;
        ;;    1.  General eye symptoms, pain, redness, swelling, discharge, watering, etc.
        ;;    2.  Visual symptoms, including distorted or enlarged image, glare,
        ;;        blurring, haloes, floaters, photophobia, etc.
        ;;    3.  Current ophthalmologic treatment, side effects.  State whether
        ;;        continuous medication is required.
        ;;    4.  For neoplasms, state date of diagnosis, exact diagnosis, whether
        ;;        benign or malignant, types and dates of treatment, and date of last
        ;;        treatment.
        ;;    5.  History of hospitalization or surgery, dates and location if known,
        ;;        reason or type of surgery.
        ;;    6.  For trauma, type of injury, cause, eye injured, and date.
        ;;    7.  Report any incapacitating episodes due to eye diseases such as
        ;;        angle-closure glaucoma, choroidopathy (including uveitis, iritis,
        ;;        cyclitis, and choroiditis), keratopathy, scleritis, retinopathy or
        ;;        maculopathy, intraocular hemorrhage, detachment of retina, or unhealed
        ;;        eye injury.  List each incapacitating episode, if any, during the past
        ;;        12-month period, its duration in days, and the cause of the episode
        ;;        of incapacitation.  Note:  An incapacitating episode is a period of
        ;;        acute symptoms severe enough to require bed rest and treatment by a
        ;;        physician or other healthcare provider.
        ;;
        ;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
        ;;
        ;;    Address each of the following, as applicable, and fully describe 
        ;;    current findings:
        ;;
        ;;    1.  Visual Acuity:
        ;;        a. Examination of visual acuity must include the central
        ;;           uncorrected and its equivalent corrected visual acuity for distance
        ;;           and near vision using Snellen's test type or its equivalent.
        ;;           Evaluate central visual acuity on the basis of corrected distance
        ;;           vision with central fixation, even if a central scotoma is present.
        ;;           Examine each eye independently and record the refractive information
        ;;           indicated below.
        ;;        b. Use Snellen's test type or its equivalent for distance and revised
        ;;           Jaegar Standard or its equivalent for near.
        ;;        c. Provided that he or she customarily wears contact lenses, determine
        ;;           the visual acuity of any individual affected by a corneal disorder
        ;;           that results in severe irregular astigmatism (including keratoconus)
        ;;           that can be improved more by contact lenses than by eyeglass lenses,
        ;;           as corrected by contact lenses.
        ;;        d. For visual acuity worse than 5/200 in either or both eyes, report
        ;;           the distance in feet/inches (or meters/centimeters) from the face at
        ;;           which the veteran can count fingers/detect hand motion/read the
        ;;           largest line on the chart.  If the veteran cannot detect hand
        ;;           motion or count fingers at any distance, state whether he or she has
        ;;           light perception.
        ;;        e. Does the lens required to correct distance vision in the poorer eye
        ;;           differ by more than three diopters from the lens required to correct
        ;;           distance vision in the better eye?  If so, explain the reason for
        ;;           the difference.
        ;;        f. Is there a difference equal to two or more scheduled steps or lines
        ;;           of visual acuity between near and distance corrected vision for
        ;;           either eye, with the near vision being worse?  If so, include at
        ;;           least two recordings of near and distance corrected vision and an
        ;;           explanation of the reason for the difference.
        ;;
        ;;                  Right Eye                FAR            NEAR
        ;;
        ;;           RIGHT EYE     Uncorrected    __________      _________
        ;;
        ;;           RIGHT EYE     CORRECTED      __________      _________
        ;;
        ;;
        ;;
        ;;                  Left Eye                 FAR            NEAR
        ;;
        ;;           LEFT EYE      Uncorrected    __________      _________
        ;;
        ;;           LEFT EYE      CORRECTED      __________      _________
        ;;
        ;;
        ;;    2.  Muscle function examination:
        ;;        a. Use a Goldmann perimeter chart that identifies the four major
        ;;           quadrants (upward, downward, left and right lateral) and the
        ;;           central field (20 degrees or less) and chart the areas of diplopia.
        ;;           Include the plotted chart with the examination report.  Indicate on
        ;;           the chart whether or not diplopia is present in the following areas:
        ;;
        ;;           Central 20 degrees
        ;;           21 to 30 degrees
        ;;                    Down
        ;;                    Left lateral
        ;;                    Right lateral
        ;;                    Up
        ;;           31 to 40 degrees
        ;;                    Down
        ;;                    Left lateral
        ;;                    Right lateral
        ;;                    Up
        ;;
        ;;        b. State whether diplopia occurs occasionally or more than
        ;;           occasionally.
        ;;        c. State whether or not diplopia is correctable with spectacles.
        ;;
        ;;    NOTE: Procedure for using Goldmann perimeter to assess diplopia field.
        ;;    1) Both eyes are open and the device is centered between the eyes.
        ;;    2) The patient's attention is directed towards a III/4e target while both
        ;;    eyes are open and fixating on the target.
        ;;    3) The patient maintains attention to the target while it is moved.  Areas
        ;;    of diplopia are identified on the VF paper.
        ;;
        ;;    3. Visual Field Examination:
        ;;       a. Use either Goldmann kinetic perimetry or automated perimetry using
        ;;          Humphrey Model 750, Octopus Model 101, or later versions of these
        ;;          perimetric devices with simulated kinetic Goldmann testing
        ;;          capability.
        ;;       b. For phakic (normal) individuals, as well as for pseudophakic or
        ;;          aphakic individuals who are well adapted to intraocular lens implant
        ;;          or contact lens correction, visual field examinations must be 
        ;;          conducted using a standard target size and luminance, which is
        ;;          Goldmann's equivalent III/4e.
        ;;       c. For aphakic individuals not well adapted to contact lens correction
        ;;          or pseudophakic individuals not well adapted to intraocular lens
        ;;          implant, visual field examinations must be conducted using Goldmann's
        ;;          equivalent IV/4e.
        ;;       d. In all cases, record the results on a standard Goldmann chart, and
        ;;          include the Goldmann chart with the examination report.  Chart at
        ;;          least 16 meridians 22 1/2 degrees apart for each eye and indicate
        ;;          the Goldmann equivalent used.
        ;;       e. If additional testing is necessary to evaluate visual fields,
        ;;          conduct the additional testing using either a tangent screen or a
        ;;          30-degree threshold visual field with the Goldmann III stimulus size.
        ;;          Include the tracing of either the tangent screen or of the 30-degree
        ;;          threshold visual field with the Goldmann III stimulus size in the
        ;;          examination report.
        ;;       f. Plot all scotomas carefully in order to allow measurements to be made
        ;;          for adjustments in the calculation of visual field defects.
        ;;
        ;;    4. Provide details of eye disease or injury (including eyebrows, 
        ;;       eyelashes, eyelids, lacrimal duct) other than loss of visual acuity,
        ;;       diplopia, or visual field defect.
        ;;    5. If there is enucleation, can a prosthesis be worn? 
        ;;    6. If nystagmus is present, state whether it is the central type.
        ;;    7. Has a lens been removed?  If so, state whether an intraocular lens
        ;;       replacement (implant) is present.
        ;;    8. If chronic conjunctivitis is present, is it active (with objective
        ;;       findings, such as red, thick conjunctivae, mucous secretion, etc.) or
        ;;       inactive?
        ;;    9. Report results of tonometry.
        ;;   10. Report results of slit lamp biomicroscopic examination.
        ;;   11. For ocular funduscopic retinal examination, report any abnormality of
        ;;       optic nerve, vessels, macula, etc.
        ;;   12. Report any other abnormalities noted.
        ;;
        ;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:  (Other than for visual acuity, 
        ;;    diplopia, and visual fields, as described above.)
        ;;    1. Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted in the 
        ;;       examination report.
        ;;
        ;;E.  Diagnosis:
        ;;
        ;;    1.  Describe the effects of the condition(s) on the veteran's usual
        ;;        occupation and daily activities.

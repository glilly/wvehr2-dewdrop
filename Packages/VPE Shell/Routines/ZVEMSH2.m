 ;;; <ESC><ESC>  This combination normally allows you to Quit back to the ">>"
 ;;;             prompt.
 ;;; <ESC>H      This will bring up any Help text.
 ;;; <ESC>Q      When you've selected a command from the Command Line History,
 ;;;             you may hit <ESC>Q if you wish to convert the command to a User
 ;;;             QWIK.
 ;;; <ESC>U      When you're editing a QWIK and are at the CODE: prompt, you can
 ;;;             hit <ESC>U to UNsave code that was SAved in either the VPE
 ;;;             routine or global editors.

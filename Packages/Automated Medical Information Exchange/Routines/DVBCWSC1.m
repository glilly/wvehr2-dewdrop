 ;;Narrative:  Many infectious diseases, immune disorders, and
 ;;nutritional deficiencies have acute phases at onset and 
 ;;accompanying recurrences but leave little or no residual 
 ;;disability beyond the acute phase.  Other such conditions may

 ;;disability.  The examiner must diligently search for residual 
 ;;disabilities upon which adjudication of the case may be made.

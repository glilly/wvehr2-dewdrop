 ;;;  B R A N C H   Submenu
 ;;;
 ;;;    R         Branch to selected Routine. Use this option when you encounter
 ;;;              a DO command in the current program and you wish to temporarily
 ;;;              view the Routine being called. You can branch to up to 4 dif-
 ;;;              ferent routines in succession. The top line of the display will
 ;;;              indicate the number of programs you have branched to and the
 ;;;              name of the current routine.
 ;;;
 ;;;    H         Hot key. When you've branched to other routines, H will allow
 ;;;              you to quickly toggle back and forth between routines.
 ;;;
 ;;;    RS        Routine search. Searches selected routines for selected strings.
 ;;;              Whenever a string is found and the display stops, you may enter
 ;;;              <RETURN> to continue, '^' to quit, '?' for Help, or 'A' for
 ;;;              Autoprint. When Autoprint is active, the display will not stop
 ;;;              when a string is located.
 ;;;
 ;;;   VEDD       View a file by branching to VPE module VELECTRONIC DATA
 ;;;              DICTIONARY.
 ;;;
 ;;;   VGL        View a global by branching to VPE module VGLOBAL LISTER. DUZ(0)
 ;;;              must contain '@' or '#'.
 ;;;
 ;;;  O T H E R   Submenu
 ;;;
 ;;;    SP        Toggles back and forth between single and double spacing. Use
 ;;;              single spacing to rapidly move through the program, and double
 ;;;              spacing to make the code easier to read.
 ;;;
 ;;;    MK        Marks the line at the top of the display. To return to this
 ;;;              line, enter 'G' for GOTO and 'MK' at the LINE NUMBER prompt.
 ;;;              This can be used as a place holder while you move elsewhere in
 ;;;              the program to follow a DO or GOTO command.
 ;;;
 ;;;  COL'n'      Entering COL and a number is a quick way to collapse backwards
 ;;;              when you've branched to a number of programs. If you are
 ;;;              currently in the 4th program, entering COL1 will return you
 ;;;              back to the 1st program.
 ;;;
 ;;;   FMC        If you are running VShell, you may access VShell's database of
 ;;;              documented Fileman Calls.
 ;;;
 ;;;   ASC        If you are running VShell, ASC will display the ASCII Character
 ;;;              Set.

        ;;

        ;;    ASSESSMENT OF EACH AFFECTED JOINT IS REQUIRED, INCLUDING JOINTS 
        ;;    WITH PROSTHESES.
        ;;
        ;;    1.  Using a goniometer, measure the ACTIVE range of motion, of the
        ;;        unaffected joint (if normal) than the affected.  Provide range of
        ;;        motion in degrees.

        ;;        the joint in relationship to one another (in degrees of flexion,
        ;;        external rotation, etc.), and state whether the ankylosis is 
        ;;        stable and pain free.
        ;;    6.  If indicated, measure the leg length from the anterior
        ;;        superior iliac spine to the medial malleolus.
        ;;    7.  For INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS, describe any constitutional signs and
        ;;        extra-articular manifestations (Follow appropriate worksheet for
        ;;        required examination findings).  State whether disease is active
        ;;        and extent of overall impairment of health.
        ;;    8.  Describe range of motion with prosthesis in same detail as described
        ;;        above for nonprosthetic joints.
        ;;
        ;;
        ;;D.  Loss of Joint Function with Use:
        ;;
        ;;    Impairment of joint function is determine by range of joint motion as
        ;;    reported in the physical examination and additional loss of range of 
        ;;    motion after repetitive use caused by the following factors:
        ;;
        ;;    -  Pain
        ;;    -  Fatigue
        ;;    -  Weakness
        ;;    -  Lack of endurance
        ;;    -  Incoordination
        ;;
        ;;    Have the veteran move the affected joint/joints through repetitive active
        ;;    range of motion, as tolerated (maximum of 3 repetitions).  After
        ;;    repetitive motion, re-measure the range of motion of the affected joint/
        ;;    joints.  Do any of the above factors cause any additional loss of range
        ;;    of motion?  If so, record the re-measured range of motion and the 
        ;;    predominant factor causing the change in motion.
        ;;
        ;;    If repetitive active range of motion of a joint cannot be done, state
        ;;    so and give the reason.
        ;;
        ;;
        ;;E.  Normal Range of Motion:  All joint Range of Motion measurements 
        ;;must be made using a goniometer.  Show each measured range of motion 
        ;;separately rather than as a continuum.  For example, if the veteran 
        ;;lacks 10 degrees of full knee extension and has normal flexion, show 
        ;;the range of motion as extension to minus 10 degrees (or lacks 10 
        ;;degrees of extension) and flexion 10 to 140 degrees.  
        ;;
        ;;    1. Hip range of motion:  (Movement of femur as it rotates in the
        ;;        acetabulum.)
        ;;
        ;;            a. Normal range of motion, using the anatomical
        ;;            position as zero degrees.
        ;;  
        ;;            Flexion = 0 to 125 degrees (To gain a true picture of hip
        ;;            flexion, i.e., movement between the pelvis and femur in 
        ;;            the hip joint, the opposite thigh should be extended to 
        ;;            minimize motion between the pelvis and spine.)
        ;;
        ;;            Extension = 0 to 30 degrees.
        ;;
        ;;            Adduction = 0 to 25 degrees.
        ;;
        ;;            Abduction = 0 to 45 degrees.
        ;;
        ;;            External rotation = 0 to 60 degrees.
        ;;
        ;;            Internal rotation = 0 to 40 degrees.
        ;;
        ;;
        ;;    2. Knee range of motion:
        ;;
        ;;            a. Normal range of motion, using the anatomical
        ;;            position as zero degrees.
        ;;
        ;;            Flexion = 0 to 140 degrees.
        ;;
        ;;            Extension - zero degrees = full extension.  Show loss of 
        ;;            extension by describing the degrees in which extension is
        ;;            not possible.  (e.g., Show range of motion as extension to
        ;;            minus 10 degrees and flexion 10 to 140 degrees when full
        ;;            extension is limited by 10 degrees and full flexion is 
        ;;            possible.)
        ;;
        ;;            b.  Stability.
        ;;
        ;;            Medial and Lateral Collateral Ligaments:
        ;;            Varus/valgus in neutral and in 30 degrees of flexion -
        ;;            normal is no motion.
        ;;
        ;;            Anterior and Posterior Cruciate Ligaments:
        ;;            Anterior/posterior in 30 degrees of flexion with
        ;;            foot stabilized - normal is less than 5 mm. of motion
        ;;            (1/4 inch - Lachman's test) or in 90 degrees of flexion
        ;;            with foot stabilized - normal is less than 5mm. of motion
        ;;            (1/4 inch - anterior and posterior drawer test).
        ;;
        ;;            Medial and Lateral Meniscus:  Perform McMurray's test.
        ;;
        ;;
        ;;    3. Ankle range of motion:
        ;;
        ;;            a.  Neutral position is with foot at 90 degrees to
        ;;                ankle.  From that position, dorsiflexion is 0 to 20
        ;;                degrees; plantar flexion is 0 to 45 degrees.
        ;;            b.  Describe any varus or valgus angulation of the
        ;;                os calcis in relationship to the long axis of the
        ;;                tibia and fibula.
        ;;
        ;;
        ;;    4. Shoulder, elbow, forearm, and wrist range of motion:
        ;;
        ;;          a. Normal range of motion is measured with zero degrees the 
        ;;          anatomical position except for 2 situations:
        ;;
        ;;               i. Supination and pronation of the
        ;;                  forearm is measured with the arm
        ;;                  against the body, the elbow
        ;;                  flexed to 90 degrees, and the
        ;;                  forearm in mid position (zero
        ;;                  degrees) between supination and
        ;;                  pronation.
        ;;              ii. Shoulder rotation is measured
        ;;                  with the arm abducted to 90
        ;;                  degrees, the elbow flexed to 90
        ;;                  degrees, and the forearm
        ;;                  reflecting the midpoint (zero
        ;;                  degrees) between internal and
        ;;                  external rotation of the shoulder.
        ;;
        ;;          b.  Shoulder forward flexion = zero to 180
        ;;              degrees.

        ;;
        ;;
        ;;F.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
        ;;
        ;;    1.  As indicated:  X-rays, including special views or weight 
        ;;        bearing films, MRI, arthrogram, diagnostic arthroscopy. 
        ;;        NOTE:  The diagnosis of degenerative arthritis or post-
        ;;        traumatic arthritis of a joint requires X-ray confirmation.  Once
        ;;        the diagnosis has been confirmed in a joint, further X-rays of
        ;;        that joint are not required.
        ;;    2.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests in the
        ;;        examination report.
        ;;

 ;;Narrative:  For VA compensation purposes, the diagnosis of fibromyalgia 
 ;;(sometimes called fibrositis, primary fibromyalgia syndrome, or 
 ;;myofascial pain syndrome) requires the presence of widespread 
 ;;musculoskeletal pain and tender points.  Additional findings may also
 ;;be present:  fatigue, sleep disturbance, stiffness, paresthesias, 
 ;;headache, irritable bowel symptoms, depression, anxiety, or Raynaud's
 ;;-like symptoms.  Widespread pain is defined as pain in both the left 
 ;;and right sides of the body, that is both above and below the waist, 
 ;;and that affects both the axial skeleton (i.e., cervical spine, 
 ;;anterior chest, thoracic spine, or low back) and the extremities.  
 ;;Rule out other diagnostic entities that may be responsible for the 
 ;;symptomatology presented.

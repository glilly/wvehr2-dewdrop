        ;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
        ;;
        ;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
        ;;
        ;;NOTE:  If examining multiple scars, report the data for each scar separately.
        ;;    1.  Type of injury or infection causing the scar or other disfigurement,
        ;;        and its date.  For burns, provide the depth of the burn (deep partial
        ;;        thickness-2nd degree, full-thickness-3rd degree, or subdermal-4th
        ;;        degree) and percent total body surface area involved.
        ;;
        ;;    2.  Current symptoms, including pain, skin breakdown (frequency), and
        ;;        other problems.
        ;;
        ;;    3.  Describe any limitations on routine daily activities or employment
        ;;        due to the scar or disfigurement.
        ;;
        ;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
        ;;
        ;;    Carefully measure all scars.  Additionally, measure areas of skin with
        ;;    certain abnormal characteristics, as specifically requested below.  Report
        ;;    all measurements in inches or centimeters (or, when reporting areas, in
        ;;    square inches or square centimeters).
        ;;
        ;;For every scar to be examined, address each of the following 8 items.
        ;;
        ;;    1.  Describe precise location of each scar, using anatomic landmarks.
        ;;        Draw diagram if necessary.  In the case of the trunk, state whether
        ;;        the scar is on the anterior portion, the posterior portion, or both
        ;;        portions.  The midaxillary line on each side divides the trunk into
        ;;        anterior and posterior portions.
        ;;
        ;;    2.  Give MEASUREMENT of length and width of each scar and calculate the
        ;;        area, for all but linear scars.  Roughly describe shape of scar, if
        ;;        it is nonlinear.
        ;;
        ;;    3.  Is the scar painful on examination?
        ;;
        ;;    4.  Is there skin breakdown?
        ;;
        ;;    5.  Is the scar superficial, meaning there is no underlying soft tissue
        ;;        damage?
        ;;
        ;;    6.  Is the scar deep, meaning there is underlying soft tissue damage?
        ;;
        ;;    7.  Describe any limitations of motion or other limitation of function
        ;;        caused by the scar.
        ;;
        ;;    8.  Is there any inflammation, edema, or keliod formation?  If so, describe.
        ;;
        ;;In addition, for scars of the head, face, and neck and for other disfigurement
        ;;of the head, face, and neck, answer the following additional 8 questions.
        ;;You need not answer these questions unless the scar or disfigurement affects
        ;;the head, face, or neck.
        ;;
        ;;    1.  Provide a MEASUREMENT of the greatest width of each scar.
        ;;
        ;;    2.  State whether the scar is adherent to underlying tissue.
        ;;
        ;;    3.  State whether the surface contour of the scar is elevated or depressed
        ;;        on palpation.
        ;;
        ;;    4.  Is there an area of abnormal texture (irregular, atrophic, shiny,
        ;;        scaly, etc.) of the skin?  If so, provide a MEASUREMENT of the area
        ;;        of abnormal texture and describe the abnormal texture.
        ;;
        ;;    5.  Is there an area of skin that is hypo- or hyper-pigmented?  If so,
        ;;        describe color of scar compared to normal areas of skin and provide
        ;;        a MEASUREMENT of the area of abnormally pigmented skin.
        ;;
        ;;    6.  Is there an area of skin that is indurated and inflexible?  If so,
        ;;        provide a MEASUREMENT of the area of induration.
        ;;
        ;;    7.  Is there an area of underlying soft tissue loss?  If yes, provide a
        ;;        MEASUREMENT of the area of underlying soft tissue loss and state
        ;;        whether or not the tissue loss is visible or palpable.
        ;;
        ;;    8.  For the face, indicate each feature or set of paired features (nose,
        ;;        chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks,
        ;;        lips) that shows gross distortion or asymmetry.
        ;;
        ;;NOTE:  With disfigurement or disfiguring scar(s) of head, face, or neck,
        ;;submit COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS.
        ;;
        ;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
        ;;
        ;;    Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted
        ;;    in the examination report.
        ;;
        ;;
        ;;E.  Diagnosis:

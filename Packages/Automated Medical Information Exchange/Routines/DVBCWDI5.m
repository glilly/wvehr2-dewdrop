        ;;E. Diagnosis:
        ;;
        ;;      1.  State whether the veteran has diabetes mellitus.  Indicate type.
        ;;      2.  Specifically list each identified complication of the veteran's
        ;;          diabetes.  Indicate these conditions as complications of the
        ;;          veteran's diabetes. If the veteran has peripheral edema,
        ;;          indicate whether it is a consequence of diabetic kidney disease
        ;;          or other non-diabetic related etiology.
        ;;      3.  For each identified complication of the veteran's diabetes,
        ;;          provide a brief rationale for your conclusion.  You may base
        ;;          your rationale on such things as the duration of the veteran's
        ;;          diabetes, whether the veteran's diabetes has been poorly
        ;;          controlled, the onset of the condition that you deem to be a
        ;;          complication of the veteran's diabetes in relation to the onset
        ;;          of the veteran's diabetes, the severity of the complication, or
        ;;          anything else you consider relevant.
        ;;      4.  Where the veteran has visual impairment, cardiovascular disease
        ;;          (including hypertension), kidney disease, neurologic disease,
        ;;          amputations, or any other disabilities which, in your opinion,
        ;;          are not complications of the veteran's diabetes, please state so
        ;;          and provide a supporting rationale as to the basis for your
        ;;          conclusion.
        ;;      5.  Where the veteran has a condition that is worsened or increased
        ;;          by the veteran's diabetes but may or may not be a diabetic
        ;;          complication, discuss the relationship between the condition and
        ;;          the veteran's diabetes. In particular, describe the baseline
        ;;          disability and the additional manifestations of the disability
        ;;          that was aggravated/worsened by diabetes.  Provide your rationale.
        ;;          Indicate if this is not possible to do without resorting to
        ;;          speculation.

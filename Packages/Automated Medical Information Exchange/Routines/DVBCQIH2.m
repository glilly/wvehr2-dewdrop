        ;;    as peripheral vascular disease or stroke, or any other condition that does
        ;;    not qualify within the generally accepted medical definition of ischemic
        ;;    heart disease.

        ;;                       (push mower), heavy yard work (digging)
        ;;
        ;;      ___ (>7-10 METs) This METs level has been found to be consistent with

        ;;^TOF^
        ;; 5. Diagnostic testing
        ;;
        ;;      Determination of cardiac hypertrophy/dilatation is required; the
        ;;      suggested order of testing for cardiac hypertrophy/dilatation is EKG,
        ;;      then chest x-ray (PA and lateral), then echocardiogram.  Echocardiogram
        ;;      is only necessary if the other two tests are negative.  A limited 
        ;;      echocardiogram, if available, is appropriate to determine if cardiac
        ;;      hypertrophy/dilatation is present by measuring only left ventricular
        ;;      dimension, wall thickness and ejection fraction.
        ;;
        ;;    Is there evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation?
        ;;             ___Yes   ___No
        ;;
        ;;    Diagnostic test (provide most recent test only):
        ;;
        ;;           ___ EKG                      Date of EKG: _________________________
        ;;
        ;;           ___ Chest x-ray              Date of CXR: _________________________
        ;;
        ;;           ___ Echocardiogram           Date of echocardiogram: ______________
        ;;
        ;;           ___ Other study (specify):____________  Date: _____________________
        ;;
        ;;    Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), if known: ____________________%
        ;;
        ;;       Date of test: _________________________
        ;;
        ;;          If LVEF testing is not of record, but available medical information
        ;;          sufficiently reflects the severity of the Veteran's cardiovascular
        ;;          condition, LVEF testing is not required.
        ;;
        ;; 6. Functional impact
        ;;
        ;;    Does the Veteran's ischemic heart disease impact his or her ability to
        ;;    work?   ___Yes   ___No
        ;;
        ;;    If yes, describe impact, providing one or more examples: _________________

        ;;Per VHA Directive 2004-038, this routine should not be modified.
        ;
        ;This routine is the one which actually gets everything moving.
        ;It moves the information from the ^TMP global into a local array
        ;[DAY(DAY)] for the three day period it's working with.  It then
        ;processes that information internally and, where necessary, by
        ;calling certain external processes.

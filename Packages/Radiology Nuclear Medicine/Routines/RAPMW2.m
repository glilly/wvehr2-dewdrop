 ;;
 ;;1. Cancelled, "No Credit", inpatient cases, and not the highest modality of a printset are excluded from this report.
 ;;   (See 3. below.)
 ;;
 ;;2. The "Days Wait" represent # of days from the Registered date (the date/time entered at the "Imaging Exam Date/Time:" prompt)
 ;;   backwards to the Date Desired for the ordered procedure.  The calculation is based on the number of different days and 
 ;;   not rounded off by hours.
 ;;
 ;;3. If the user did not select a specific CPT Code or Procedure Name, then the cases from a printset (group of cases that 
 ;;   share the same report) will have only the case with the highest ranked modality printed.  Modalities are ranked 
 ;;   in this order, (1) being the highest:
 ;;   (1) Interventional, (2) MRI, (3) CT, (4) Cardiac Stress test, (5) Nuc Med, (6) US, (7) Mammo, (8) General Rad (9) Other
 ;;   However, all the cases from an examset (group of cases that have separate reports) will all be listed.
 ;;
 ;;4. "Procedure Types" are assigned by a national CPT code look-up table and may differ from locally defined "Imaging Types."  
 ;;   Therefore the number of procedures in each category may not be the same as other radiology management reports.
 ;;
 ;;5. Procedure Type of "unknown" refers to either cases that have no matching procedure type in the spreadsheet of CPT Codes
 ;;   provided by the Office of Patient Care Services, or cases that are missing data for the procedure.
 ;;
 ;;6. CPT Code is not available for parent and broad procedures in the header section.  CPT Code of the parent order's highest
 ;;   ranked modality case will be printed in the line by line section.  (See 3. above.)
 ;;
 ;;7. Date/Time Registered is the "Imaging Exam Date/Time" entered by the user during Registration.
 ;;
 ;;8. "*" under the "Date Register" column denotes the request was cancelled and re-ordered on the same day that it was cancelled.
 ;;
 ;;9. "p" under the "Case #" column, before the case number, denotes printset case with the highest ranked Procedure Type.

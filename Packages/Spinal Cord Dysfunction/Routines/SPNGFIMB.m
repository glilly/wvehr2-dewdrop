 ;;The median FIM Motor Score for individuals with similar SCIs at one
 ;;year following their injury is 13 (interquartile range 13-18).  Other
 ;;important considerations for individuals with motor complete C1-C3
 ;;tetraplegia include ventilator use and inability to clear secretions,
 ;;equipment or assistance to provide pressure relief and/or positioning,
 ;;and communication equipment or assistance.  Accessible public
 ;;transportation or an attendant-operated van with lift and tie-downs is
 ;;needed.  The veteran should be able to instruct all aspects of care,
 ;;but will need total assistance for homemaking.

 ;;The median FIM Motor Score for individuals with similar SCIs at one
 ;;year following their injury is 18 (interquartile range 13-23).  Other 
 ;;important considerations for individuals with motor complete C4
 ;;tetraplegia include whether the person is able to breathe without
 ;;ventilator use.  Assistance with clearing secretions may be needed due
 ;;to an inability to cough. There is need for equipment or assistance to
 ;;provide pressure relief and/or positioning, and communication
 ;;equipment or assistance.  Accessible public transportation or an
 ;;attendant-operated van with lift and tie-downs is needed.  The veteran
 ;;should be able to instruct all aspects of care, but will need total
 ;;assistance for homemaking.

 ;;The median FIM Motor Score for individuals with similar SCIs at
 ;;one year following their injury is 23 (interquartile range 20.5-33.5).
 ;;Other important considerations for individuals with motor complete
 ;;C5 tetraplegia include low respiratory endurance and vital capacity
 ;;secondary to paralysis of intercostals; assistance may be needed to
 ;;clear secretions.  There is a need for equipment to be independent
 ;;with pressure relief and/or positioning.  In order to be independent
 ;;with communication, some assistance is needed with equipment set-
 ;;up of adaptive devices for page turning, writing, button pushing, etc
 ;;Accessible public transportation or an attendant-operated van with
 ;;lift and tie-downs is needed.  The veteran should be able to instruct
 ;;all aspects of care, but will need total assistance for homemaking.

 ;;The median FIM Motor Score for individuals with similar SCIs at one
 ;;year following their injury is 27 (interquartile range 22-42).  Other 
 ;;important considerations for individuals with motor complete C6
 ;;tetraplegia include low respiratory endurance and vital capacity
 ;;secondary to paralysis of intercostals; assistance may be needed to
 ;;clear secretions.  There is a need for equipment or adapted techniques
 ;;to be independent with pressure relief and/or positioning.
 ;;Independence with communication may be achieved with or without
 ;;assistance from adaptive devices for tenodesis, page turning, writing,
 ;;button pushing, keyboard use, object manipulation, etc.  Independent
 ;;driving from a wheelchair may be possible with a modified van with
 ;;lift, sensitized hand controls, and tie-downs.  The veteran should be 
 ;;able to instruct all aspects of care, having the ability to do some
 ;;light meal preparation, but will need total assistance for all other
 ;;homemaking.

 ;;Narrative:  Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness characterized
 ;;by debilitating fatigue and several flu-like symptoms.  It may have

 ;;       reduce or impair average daily activity below 50 percent of the
 ;;       patient's pre-illness activity level for a period of 6 months,
 ;;       and
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;   2.  Other clinical conditions that may produce similar symptoms 
 ;;       must be excluded by thorough evaluation, based on history, 
 ;;       physical examination, and appropriate laboratory tests.
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;   IT MUST ALSO MEET SIX OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING TEN CRITERIA:
 ;;   1.  Describe in detail:

 ;;        treatment by a physician), what is their frequency and duration?.
 ;;
 ;;

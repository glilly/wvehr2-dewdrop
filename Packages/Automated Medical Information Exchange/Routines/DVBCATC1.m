TXT10 ;;A veteran who is in receipt of the highest level of basic
 ;;            special monthly compensation for multiple service-connected
 ;;            disabilitites causing need for regular aid and attendance may
 ;;            be entitled to a higher rate if, because of the service-connected
 ;;            conditions, the veteran requires the daily health-care services
 ;;            of a skilled provider, without which he/she would require hospital,
 ;;            nursing home, or other institutional care.  These services may be
 ;;            provided by a family member or other individual under the
 ;;            supervision of a physician or other health-care professional.
 ;;
 ;;            Personal health-care services include, but are not limited to,
 ;;            physical therapy, administration of injections, placement of
 ;;            indwelling catheters, and the changing of sterile dressings, or
 ;;            like functions which require professional health-care training
 ;;            or the regular supervision of a trained health-care professional
 ;;            to perform.  A licensed health-care professional includes, but
 ;;            is not limited to, a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, a
 ;;            registered nurse, a licensed practical nurse, or a licensed
 ;;            physical therapist.  Only a VA physician may certify the need
 ;;            for higher level of care.
 ;;
 ;;            Special note:  Veterans with potential entitlement to higher
 ;;            level of aid and attendance are commonly unable to travel except
 ;;            by ambulance.  Before calling a veteran in for examination, a
 ;;            physician should review treatment records, if available, and
 ;;            determine whether need can be determined by record review and
 ;;            telephone contact with the veteran and/or the skilled provider.
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;A.  Indicate if the veteran requires the daily health-care services of a

 ;;provider, state "daily services not required" and go to the end of the
 ;;exam):

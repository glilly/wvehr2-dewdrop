        ;;Provider (PCP) or their Associate Primary Care Provider (AP) before
        ;;that date.  The patient may be reactivated to their previous PCP and PC

        ;;VHA DIRECTIVE 2003-063, ACTIVE PATIENTS IN PCMM, establishes the rules for
        ;;PCMM automated inactivation of patients.  The following is from that Directive.

        ;;Inactivation of primary care patients from a PCMM panel occurs under the
        ;;following circumstances:

        ;;(b) Newly assigned patients (either newly-enrolled patients or patients who
        ;;have been re-assigned to a different provider) who have not been seen by
        ;;their PCP or Associate Provider (AP) and 12 months have passed since
        ;;the time of assignment to that provider.  This provides every PCP a 1-year
        ;;grace period for seeing patients added to their panel (either newly-enrolled
        ;;patients or patients transferred from a different panel) before they are
        ;;inactivated.  Patients must be seen by their PCP or AP within 12 months of
        ;;being assigned, or they need to be inactivated from the PCP's panel.
        ;;(c) Established patients that have been assigned to the PCP's panel for more 
        ;;than 12 months, but have not been seen by their PCP or AP in the past 24 months
        ;;need to be inactivated.

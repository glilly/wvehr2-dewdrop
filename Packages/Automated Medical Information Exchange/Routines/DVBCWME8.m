 ;;E. Diagnosis:
 ;;
 ;;    Provide:
 ;;
 ;;    1. The Diagnosis must conform to DSM-IV and be supported by the findings
 ;;       on the examination report.
 ;;    2. If the diagnosis is changed, explain fully whether the new diagnosis
 ;;       represents a progression of the prior diagnosis or development of a new
 ;;       and separate condition.
 ;;    3. If there are multiple mental disorders, delineate to the extent possible
 ;;       the symptoms associated with each and a discussion of relationship.
 ;;    4. Evaluation is based on the effects of the signs and symptoms on
 ;;       occupational and social functioning.
 ;;
 ;;    NOTE:  VA is prohibited by statute, 38 U.S.C. 1110, from paying compensation
 ;;    for a disability that is a result of the veteran's own ALCOHOL OR DRUG
 ;;    ABUSE.  However, when a veteran's alcohol or drug abuse disability is
 ;;    secondary to or is caused or aggravated by a primary service-connected
 ;;    disorder, the veteran may be entitled to compensation.  See Allen v.
 ;;    Principi, 237 F.3d 1368, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  Therefore, it is important
 ;;    to determine the relationship, if any, between a service-connected disorder
 ;;    and a disability resulting from the veteran's alcohol or drug abuse.
 ;;    Unless alcohol or drug abuse is secondary to or is caused or aggravated
 ;;    by another mental disorder, you should separate, to the extent possible,
 ;;    the effects of the alcohol or drug abuse from the effects of the other
 ;;    mental disorder(s).  If it is not possible to separate the effects in
 ;;    such cases, please explain why.
 ;;
 ;;F. Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF):
 ;;
 ;;    NOTE:  The complete multi-axial format as specified by DSM-IV may be
 ;;    required by BVA REMAND or specifically requested by the rating specialist.
 ;;    If so, include the GAF score and note whether it refers to current
 ;;    functioning.  A BVA REMAND may also request, in addition to an overall
 ;;    GAF score, that a separate GAF score be provided for each mental disorder
 ;;    present when there are multiple Axis I or Axis II diagnoses and not all
 ;;    are service-connected.  If separate GAF scores can be given, an explanation
 ;;    and discussion of the rationale is needed. If it is not possible, an
 ;;    explanation as to why not is needed. (See the above note pertaining to
 ;;    alcohol or drug abuse.)
 ;;
 ;;G. Effects of the Mental Disorder on Occupational and Social Functioning:
 ;;
 ;;Evaluation of Mental Disorders is based on their effects on occupational
 ;;and social functioning.  Select the appropriate assessment of the veteran
 ;;from the choices below:
 ;;
 ;;   - Total occupational and social impairment due to Mental Disorder signs
 ;;     and symptoms.
 ;;
 ;;     Provide examples and pertinent symptoms, including those already reported
 ;;
 ;;                             OR
 ;;
 ;;   - Mental Disorder signs and symptoms result in deficiencies in most of
 ;;     the following areas:  work, school, family relations, judgment,
 ;;     thinking, and mood.
 ;;
 ;;     Provide examples and pertinent symptoms, including those already reported
 ;;     for each affected area.
 ;;
 ;;                             OR
 ;;
 ;;   - There is reduced reliability and productivity due to Mental Disorder
 ;;     signs and symptoms.
 ;;
 ;;     Provide examples and pertinent symptoms, including those already reported.
 ;;
 ;;                             OR
 ;;
 ;;   - There is occasional decrease in work efficiency or there are intermittent
 ;;     periods of inability to perform occupational tasks due to Mental Disorder
 ;;     signs and symptoms, but generally satisfactory functioning (routine
 ;;     behavior, self-care, and conversation normal).
 ;;
 ;;     Provide examples and pertinent symptoms, including those already reported.
 ;;
 ;;                             OR
 ;;
 ;;   - There is Mental Disorder signs and symptoms that are transient or mild,
 ;;     which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational
 ;;     tasks only during periods of significant stress.
 ;;
 ;;     Provide examples and pertinent symptoms, including those already reported.
 ;;
 ;;                             OR
 ;;
 ;;   - Mental Disorder symptoms require continuous medication.
 ;;
 ;;                             OR
 ;;
 ;;   - Select all that apply:
 ;;   - Mental Disorder symptoms are not severe enough to require continuous
 ;;     medication.
 ;;   - Mental Disorder symptoms are not severe enough to interfere with
 ;;     occupational and social functioning.
 ;;

 ;;licensed psychologist, psychiatry resident or psychology intern,
 ;;LCSW, or NP); circumstances under which you performed the examination,
 ;;if applicable, (i.e., under the close supervision of an attending

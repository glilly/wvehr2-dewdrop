 ;;Narration:  Veterans during World War II, the Korean War, and in smaller 
 ;;numbers during other campaigns, have suffered cold injuries, including
 ;;frostbite (freezing cold injury or FCI) and immersion foot (nonfreezing 
 ;;cold injury or NCI).  Documentation of such injuries may be lacking 
 ;;because of battlefield conditions.  A number of long-term and delayed
 ;;sequelae to cold injuries are recognized, including peripheral neuropathy, 
 ;;skin cancer in frostbite scars, and arthritis in involved limbs.
 ;;
 ;;Review Examination:  Any veteran examined for residuals of cold injury
 ;;should undergo a cold injury protocol examination IF it has not already 
 ;;been carried out.  If the veteran has already had a cold injury protocol 
 ;;examination, only an interval history is required, and the extent of 
 ;;the examination, laboratory tests performed, etc., will be determined
 ;;by the examiner based on the history, and as requested.
 ;;
 ;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
 ;;
 ;;HISTORY OF COLD INJURY:  If the cold injury protocol form has been 
 ;;filled out by the veteran, most details about the circumstances of the
 ;;acute cold injury and its subsequent course will be recorded.  Review
 ;;for any needed expansion or clarification by the veteran.  If the 
 ;;protocol history form has not been completed, obtain the following 
 ;;history and comment on each:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Description of the circumstances of the cold injury.
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;    2.  Parts of the body affected.

 ;;

 ;;
 ;;    4.  The type of treatment and where it was administered.
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;    5.  Any treatment since service - where and what type.
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;    6.  Current symptoms - specifically inquire about:
 ;;

        ;;NOTE:  To clarify Item VII above:  "Instrumental activities of daily living"
        ;;       refers to activities other than self-care that are needed for
        ;;       independent living, such as meal preparation, doing housework, and other
        ;;       chores, shopping, traveling, doing laundry, being responsible for one's
        ;;       own medications, and using a telephone.  These activities are
        ;;       distinguished from "Activities of daily living", which refer to basic
        ;;       self-care and include bathing or showering, dressing, eating, getting
        ;;       in or out of bed or a chair, and using the toilet.
        ;;
        ;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
        ;;
        ;;    1. Skull X-rays to measure bony defect, if any, due to surgery or injury.
        ;;    2. Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted in the
        ;;       examination report.
        ;;
        ;;E.  Diagnosis:
        ;;
        ;;    1. List each diagnosis.
        ;;    2. Capacity to manage financial affairs
        ;;       Mental competency, for VA benefits purposes, refers only to the ability
        ;;       of the veteran to manage VA benefit payments in his or her own best
        ;;       interest, and not to any other subject.  Mental incompetency, for VA
        ;;       benefits purposes, means that the veteran, because of injury or disease,
        ;;       is not capable to managing benefit payments in his or her own best
        ;;       interest.  In order to assist raters in making a legal determination
        ;;       as to competency, please address the following:
        ;;
        ;;       a. What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability to
        ;;          manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration of such
        ;;          things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit payment,
        ;;          knowing the amounts and types of bills owed monthly, and handling
        ;;          the payment prudently?  Does the veteran handle money and pay the
        ;;          bills himself or herself?
        ;;       b. Based on your examination, do you believe the veteran is capable of
        ;;          managing his or her financial affairs?  Please provide examples to
        ;;          support your conclusion.  If you believe a Social Work Service
        ;;          assessment is needed before you can give your opinion on the
        ;;          veteran's ability to manage his or her financial affairs, please
        ;;          explain why.
        ;;
        ;;    3. Note:  When a mental disorder is present, state, or ask the mental
        ;;       disorders examiner to state, to the extent possible, which
        ;;       emotional/behavior signs and symptoms are part of a co-morbid mental
        ;;       disorder and which represent residuals of TBI.  If it is impossible to
        ;;       make such a determination without speculation, so state.

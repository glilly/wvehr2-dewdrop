 ;;Narrative:  This is a complete, base-line examination covering all 
 ;;parts of the body, not just the areas claimed by the veteran.  The 
 ;;examiner may request any additional studies or examinations as needed
 ;;for proper diagnosis and evaluation.  All important negatives should 
 ;;be reported.  If a diagnosis is uncovered that was not originally 
 ;;claimed by the veteran, complete the appropriate worksheet, in 
 ;;addition to this one.  A general medical examination may also be 
 ;;requested as evidence for non service-connected disability pension 
 ;;claims or for claimed entitlement to individual unemployability 
 ;;benefits in service-connected disability compensation claims.

 ;;        disability which prevents the veteran from attending to 
 ;;        financial matters in person is not a proper basis for a 
 ;;        finding of incompetency unless the veteran is, by reason of 
 ;;        that disability, incapable of directing someone else in 
 ;;        handling the individual's financial affairs.)

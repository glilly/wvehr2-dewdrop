 ;;2.0;INCOME VERIFICATION MATCH;**14**; 21-OCT-94
 ;;Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this routine should not be modified.
 ;
 ; This routine is called by IB to update insurance segments sent
 ; from HEC and stored in the INCOMING SEGMENT multiple of the IVM
 ; PATIENT file (#301.5).  A HL7 message is sent to HEC indicating if
 ; the data is accepted or rejected (including reason for rejection).
 ;
 ; Before this call, IB code allows the user to to review the
 ; insurance policy from HEC stored in IB's insurance module.  When
 ; the user decides to accept or reject the policy, this routine is
 ; called.  If the policy is rejected, this routine allows the user
 ; to pick the reason for rejection.

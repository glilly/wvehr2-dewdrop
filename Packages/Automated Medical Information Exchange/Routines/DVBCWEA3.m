 ;; 
 ;;           a. CAPACITY TO MANAGE FINANCIAL AFFAIRS
 ;;
 ;;           Mental competency, for VA benefits purposes, refers only to
 ;;           the ability of the veteran to manage VA benefit payments in his
 ;;           or her own best interest, and not to any other subject.
 ;;           Mental incompetency, for VA benefits purposes, means that
 ;;           the veteran, because of injury or disease, is not capable of
 ;;           managing benefit payments in his or her best interest.
 ;;           In order to assist raters in making a legal determination as to
 ;;           competency, please address the following:
 ;;                What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability
 ;;                to manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration
 ;;                of such things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit
 ;;                payment, knowing the amounts and types of bills owed monthly,
 ;;                and handling the payment prudently? Does the veteran handle
 ;;                the money and pay the bills himself or herself?
 ;;
 ;;                Based on your examination, do you believe that the veteran is
 ;;                capable of managing his or her financial affairs?
 ;;                Please provide examples to support your conclusion.
 ;;
 ;;                If you believe a Social Work Service assessment is needed before
 ;;                you can give your opinion on the veteran's ability to manage his
 ;;                or her financial affairs, please explain why.
 ;;
 ;;      b.  OTHER OPINION: Furnish any other specific opinion requested
 ;;          by the rating board or BVA Remand, furnishing the complete 
 ;;          rationale and citation of medical texts or treatise supporting 
 ;;          opinion, if medical literature review was undertaken. If the
 ;;          requested opinion is medically not ascertainable on exam or
 ;;          testing, please state WHY. If the requested opinion cannot 
 ;;          be expressed without resorting to speculation or making 
 ;;          improbable assumptions say so, and explain why. If the opinion 
 ;;          asks "...is it at least as likely as not...", fully explain
 ;;          the clinical findings and rationale for the opinion.
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;  2.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted 
 ;;      in the examination report.

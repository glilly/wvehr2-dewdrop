 ;;TOF
 ;;   NOTE: Service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) requires
 ;;   medical evidence establishing a diagnosis of the condition that conforms
 ;;   to the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV, credible supporting evidence that
 ;;   the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and a link, established
 ;;   by medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed
 ;;   in-service stressor.  It is the responsibility of the examiner to describe
 ;;   the traumatic stressor leading to PTSD, if he or she makes the diagnosis
 ;;   of PTSD.
 ;;
 ;;   A diagnosis of PTSD cannot be adequately documented or ruled out without
 ;;   obtaining a detailed military history and reviewing the claims folder. 
 ;;   This means that initial review of the folder prior to examination, the
 ;;   history and examination itself, and the dictation for an examination
 ;;   initially establishing PTSD will often require more time than for 
 ;;   examinations of other disorders.  Ninety minutes to two hours on an
 ;;   initial exam is normal.
 ;;
 ;;     Post-Military Trauma History (refer to social-industrial survey if
 ;;     completed)
 ;;
 ;;   - describe post-military traumatic events (see CAPS trauma assessment
 ;;     checklist)

 ;;     (treatment received, disruption to work, adverse health consequences)
 ;;
 ;;     Post-Military Psychosocial Adjustment (refer to social-industrial survey
 ;;     if completed)
 ;;
 ;;   - legal history (DWIs, arrests, time spent in jail)
 ;;   - educational accomplishment
 ;;   - employment history (describe periods of unemployment and reasons)
 ;;   - marital and family relationships (including quality of relationships with
 ;;     children)
 ;;   - degree and quality of social relationships
 ;;   - activities and leisure pursuits
 ;;   - substance use and consequences of substance use
 ;;   - significant medical disorders (resulting pain or disability; current
 ;;     medications)
 ;;   - treatment history for significant medical conditions, including 
 ;;     hospitalizations
 ;;   - history of inpatient and/or outpatient psychiatric care (dates and
 ;;     conditions treated)
 ;;   - history of assaultiveness
 ;;   - history of suicide attempts
 ;;   - summary statement of current psychosocial functional status (performance
 ;;     in employment or schooling, routine responsibilities of self care,
 ;;     family role functioning, physical health, social/interpersonal
 ;;     relationships, recreation/leisure pursuits).
 ;;TOF

        ;;SE  Select Recess Weeks
        ;;    Enter SE at the Select Action prompt to select weeks by the number
        ;;    in the left hand column of the list.  You may select multiple
        ;;    weeks by entering week numbers separated by commas and you may
        ;;    select a range of weeks by using a hyphen.  For example: 3,6-10,12
        ;;    is a valid response to select weeks.  This action will then prompt
        ;;    for the hours to enter for all of the weeks selected.  If the
        ;;    weeks are in the past the tour of duty hours stored in the
        ;;    employee's timecard may be used by accepting the default to use
        ;;    tour of duty hours.  Alternatively you can choose to use the
        ;;    employee's current tour hours from the timecard as the recess
        ;;    hours or you may specify the recess hours for each week of the
        ;;    pay period for the weeks selected.  In all cases the recess hours
        ;;    specified are applied to all the weeks selected.
        ;;EH  Edit Recess Hours
        ;;    Enter EH at the Select Action prompt to select any of the weeks
        ;;    in the list by number.  You will be prompted to enter the recess
        ;;    hours for each week that you selected.
        ;;CR  Cancel Recess Weeks
        ;;    Enter CR at the Select Action prompt to select any of the weeks
        ;;    in the list by number.  Any recess hours from the selection will
        ;;    be removed.
        ;;NS  Change AWS Start
        ;;    Enter NS at the Select Action prompt to change when the AWS
        ;;    schedule takes effect.  Any recess scheduled during the fiscal
        ;;    year that occurs before the new start date is removed.  If you
        ;;    enter a date other than the first day of a pay period the action
        ;;    will automatically set the AWS start date to the first day of
        ;;    the pay period that the date you entered falls within.
        ;;    The number of weeks available for recess is 25% of the weeks
        ;;    from the start date to the end of the fiscal year.

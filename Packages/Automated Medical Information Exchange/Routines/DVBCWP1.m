 ;;Narrative: This is the protocol for conducting initial examinations on former 
 ;;POWs.  Approach these veterans with the greatest sensitivity because the 
 ;;POW experience likely resulted in a great deal of psychological and physical 
 ;;trauma.  Details about beatings, torture, forced marches, forced labor, diet, 
 ;;disease, brainwashing, extremes of hot and cold, and anxiety may be 
 ;;significant parts of the veteran's history; eliciting these details requires  
 ;;that one establish a trusting relationship with the veteran. Examine
 ;;veteran for each disability / disease / condition veteran is claiming 
 ;;as a consequence of the POW experience.  A former POW may be entitled 
 ;;to service connection for presumptive POW diseases; the worksheet contains
 ;;a list of these presumptive diseases.  Based on veteran's claim(s) and your
 ;;findings, please refer to and follow additional worksheets to assure
 ;;the examination  provides information adequate for rating purposes.

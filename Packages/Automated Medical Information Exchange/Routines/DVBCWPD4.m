 ;;
 ;;NOTE: Service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) requires
 ;;medical evidence establishing a diagnosis of the condition that conforms
 ;;to the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV, credible supporting evidence that
 ;;the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and a link, established by
 ;;medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service 
 ;;stressor. It is the responsibility of the examiner to indicate the traumatic
 ;;stressor leading to PTSD, if he or she makes the diagnosis of PTSD.
 ;;  Crucial in this description are specific details of the stressor, with names,
 ;;  dates, and places linked to the stressor, so that the rating specialist can
 ;;  confirm that the cited stressor occurred during active duty.
 ;;
 ;;A diagnosis of PTSD cannot be adequately documented or ruled out without
 ;;obtaining a detailed military history and reviewing the claims folder. 
 ;;This means that initial review of the folder prior to examination, the history
 ;;and examination itself, and the dictation for an examination initially
 ;;establishing PTSD will often require more time than for examinations of other
 ;;disorders.  Ninety minutes to two hours on an initial exam is normal.
 ;;
 ;;   Post-Military Trauma History (refer to social-industrial survey if completed)
 ;;
 ;;   * describe post-military traumatic events (see CAPS trauma assessment
 ;;     checklist)

 ;;     family role functioning, physical health, social/interpersonal
 ;;     relationships, recreation/leisure pursuits)
 ;;

        ;;                pressure readings on the day of the examination.  If they
        ;;                are suggestive of hypertension or are borderline, readings
        ;;                must be taken two or more times on each of at least two
        ;;                additional days to rule hypertension in or out.
        ;;            v.  In the diagnostic summary, state whether hypertension is
        ;;                ruled in or out after completing these B.P. measurements.
        ;;                If hypertensive heart disease is suspected or found, follow

        ;;        b. Separately examine and describe in detail each affected joint.
        ;;           Measure active range of motion in degrees using a goniometer.
        ;;           State whether there is objective evidence of pain on motion.
        ;;           After 3 repetitions of the range of motion, state whether there
        ;;           are additional limitations of range of motion and whether there
        ;;           is objective evidence of pain on motion.  Also state the most
        ;;           important factor (pain, weakness, fatigue, lack of endurance,
        ;;           incoordination) for any additional loss of motion after
        ;;           repetitive motion.  Report the range of motion after 3
        ;;           repetitions.  (See the appropriate musculoskeletal worksheet for

        ;;        e. If there is amputation of a part, see the appropriate worksheet.
        ;;
        ;;        f. With disc disease, also describe any abnormal neurological
        ;;           findings and total duration in days or weeks of incapacitating
        ;;           episodes (an incapacitating episode is a period of acute signs
        ;;           and symptoms due to intervertebral disc syndrome that requires
        ;;           bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician).
        ;;
        ;;   18.  ENDOCRINE:  Describe signs and symptoms of any endocrine disease,

        ;;        hension of commands, hallucinations or delusions, and intelligence.
        ;;        (This is meant to be a brief screening examination.  If a mental
        ;;        disorder is claimed, or suspected based on the screening, an
        ;;        examination for diagnosis and assessment should be conducted by
        ;;        a psychiatrist or psychologist).
        ;;
        ;;D.  DIAGNOSTIC AND CLINICAL TESTS:
        ;;
        ;;    1.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted
        ;;        in the examination report.

        ;;    4.  The diagnosis of degenerative or traumatic arthritis of any joint
        ;;        requires X-ray confirmation, but once confirmed by X-ray, either
        ;;        in service or after service, no further X-rays of that joint are
        ;;        required for disability evaluation purposes.
        ;;
        ;;E.  DIAGNOSIS:
        ;;
        ;;    1.  Provide a summary list of all disabilities diagnosed.  Include an
        ;;        interpretation of the results of all diagnostic and other tests
        ;;        conducted in the final summary and diagnosis.
        ;;
        ;;    2.  For each condition diagnosed, describe its effect on the veteran's
        ;;        usual occupation and daily activities.
        ;;
        ;;    3.  CAPACITY TO MANAGE FINANCIAL AFFAIRS:  Mental competency, for VA
        ;;        benefits purposes, refers only to the ability of the veteran to
        ;;        manage VA benefit payments in his or her own best interest, and not
        ;;        to any other subject.  Mental incompetency, for VA benefits purposes,
        ;;        means that the veteran, because of injury or disease, is not capable
        ;;        of managing benefit payments in his or her own best interest.  In
        ;;        order to assist raters in making a legal determination as to
        ;;        competency, please address the following:
        ;;
        ;;        What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability
        ;;        to manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration of
        ;;        such things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit payment,
        ;;        knowing the amounts and types of bills owed monthly, and handling
        ;;        the payment prudently?  Does the veteran handle the money and pay
        ;;        the bills himself or herself?
        ;;
        ;;        Based on your examination, do you believe that the veteran is
        ;;        capable of managing his or her financial affairs?  Please provide
        ;;        examples to support your conclusion.
        ;;
        ;;        If you believe a Social Work Service assessment is needed before
        ;;        you can give your opinion on the veteran's ability to manage his
        ;;        or her financial affairs, please explain why.

        ;;Narrative:  An examination of hearing impairment must be conducted by a
        ;;state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech
        ;;discrimination test (specifically, the Maryland CNC recording) and a
        ;;pure tone audiometry test in a sound isolated booth that meets American
        ;;National Standards Institute standards (ANSI S3.1.1991) for ambient noise.
        ;;Measurements will be reported at the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000,
        ;;and 4000 Hz.  The examination will include the following tests: Pure tone
        ;;audiometry by air conduction at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and
        ;;8000 Hz, and by bone conduction at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and
        ;;4000 Hz, spondee thresholds, speech recognition using the recorded
        ;;Maryland CNC Test, tympanometry and acoustic reflex tests, and, when
        ;;necessary, Stenger tests.  Bone conduction thresholds are measured 
        ;;when the air conduction thresholds are poorer than 15 dB HL.  A modified
        ;;Hughson-Westlake procedure will be used with appropriate masking.  A
        ;;Stenger must be administered whenever pure tone air conduction
        ;;thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz differ by 20 dB or more
        ;;between the two ears.  Maximum speech recognition will be reported with
        ;;the 50 word VA approved recording of the Maryland CNC test.  The starting
        ;;presentation level will be 40dB re SRT.  If necessary, the starting level
        ;;will be adjusted upward to obtain a level at least 5 dB above the threshold
        ;;at 2000 Hz, if not above the patient's tolerance level.  The examination
        ;;will be conducted without the use of hearing aids.  Both ears must be
        ;;examined for hearing impairment even if hearing loss in only one ear is
        ;;at issue.
        ;;
        ;;   When speech recognition is 92% or less, a performance intensity
        ;;   function must be obtained.
        ;;
        ;;Procedures for Obtaining a Modified Performance-Intensity Function
        ;;   1.  The starting level is 40 dB re: SRT (speech reception threshold).
        ;;   The starting level will be adjusted upward to obtain a level at least
        ;;   5 dB above the threshold at 2000 Hz, if not above the patient's
        ;;   tolerance level.
        ;;   2.  Present 25 words at 6 dB above and 6 dB below the starting level.
        ;;   3.  If recognition performance improves less than 6%, then maximum word
        ;;   recognition performance has been obtained.
        ;;       Example:  starting level=50 dB HL.  Initial performance=80%.
        ;;       Decrease level to 44 dB HL.  Performance decreases to 76%.  Increase
        ;;       level to 56 dB HL.  Performance increases to 84%.  Test level for
        ;;       full list=50 dB HL.
        ;;   4.  If performance improves by 6% or more at the first 6-dB increment,
        ;;   then word recognition is measured using another 25 words at an
        ;;   additional 6-dB increment.
        ;;       Example:  starting level=50 dB HL.  Initial performance=80%.
        ;;       Increase level to 56 dB HL.  Performance improves to 88% (+8%).
        ;;       Increase level to 62 dB HL.  Performance decreases to 84% (-4%).
        ;;       Test level for full list=56 dB HL.
        ;;   5.  A full list (50 words) is then presented at the level of maximum
        ;;   performance.  The word recognition performance at this level is reported
        ;;   as the speech recognition score.  Only the best performance for a full
        ;;   list (50 words) will be reported.

        ;;A.  Review of Medical Records: Indicate whether the C-file was reviewed.
        ;;
        ;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
        ;;
        ;;      Comment on:
        ;;
        ;;        1.  Chief complaint.
        ;;        2.  Effects of the condition on occupational functioning and daily
        ;;            activities.
        ;;        3.  Pertinent service history.
        ;;        4.  History of military, occupational, and recreational noise
        ;;            exposure.
        ;;        5.  Pertinent family and social history; history of ear disease,
        ;;            head or ear trauma, etc.
        ;;        6.  Tinnitus.
        ;;
        ;;              a.  Is there a claim for tinnitus (verify from examination
        ;;                  request, i.e., 2507)?  (yes/no)
        ;;              b.  Is there a current complaint of tinnitus? (yes/no)  If yes
        ;;                  answer the following questions whether or not the condition
        ;;                  is claimed.
        ;;              c.  Date and circumstances of onset.
        ;;              d.  Whether it is constant or recurrent (intermittent). 
        ;;                  Current complaints only.
        ;;              e.  If there is a claim and no current complaint, the
        ;;                  audiologist must:
        ;;
        ;;                  State when veteran last experienced tinnitus.
        ;;
        ;;                  Describe the tinnitus experienced at that time.
        ;;
        ;;                  Describe intervening course between onset and last episode,
        ;;                  e.g., how frequently in a year does a veteran experience
        ;;                  tinnitus.
        ;;
        ;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
        ;;
        ;;    1.  Measure and record puretone thresholds in decibels at the indicated
        ;;        frequencies (air conduction):
        ;;
        ;;    = = = = =RIGHT EAR= = = = = = = = = = = = = LEFT EAR = = = = = = 
        ;;    A*    B    C    D    E    **       A*   B    C   D    E     **
        ;;    500|1000|2000|3000|4000|average   500|1000|2000|3000|4000|average
        ;;       |    |    |    |    |             |    |    |    |    |
        ;;  
        ;;    *  The puretone threshold at 500 Hz is not used in calculating the
        ;;       puretone threshold average for evaluation purposes but is used in
        ;;       determining whether or not, for VA purposes, a hearing impairment
        ;;       reaches the level of a disability.  Puretone thresholds should not
        ;;       exceed 105 decibels or the tolerance level.
        ;;    ** The average of B, C, D, and E.
        ;;
        ;;    2.  Speech Recognition Score: Maryland CNC word list
        ;;
        ;;                         _____% right ear _____% left ear.
        ;;
        ;;    When only puretone results should be used to evaluate hearing loss, 
        ;;    the examiner, who must be a state-licensed audiologist, should certify
        ;;    that language difficulties or other problems (specify what the problems
        ;;    are) make the combined use of puretone average and speech
        ;;    discrimination inappropriate.
        ;;
        ;;    Thresholds should not exceed 100 decibels or the tolerance level.
        ;;
        ;;    Pausing:  Examiners should pause when necessary during speech
        ;;    recognition tests, in order to give the veteran sufficient time to
        ;;    respond.  This will ensure that the test results are based on actual
        ;;    hearing loss rather than on the effects of other problems that might
        ;;    slow a veteran's response.  There are a variety of problems that might
        ;;    require pausing, for example, the presence of cognitive impairment.  It
        ;;    is up to the examiner to determine when to use pausing and the length
        ;;    of the pauses.
        ;;
        ;;    Need for a modified performance-intensity function:  The normal speech
        ;;    recognition performance is 94% or better for a full (50 word) list.  If
        ;;    speech recognition is worse than 94% after presentation of a full list,
        ;;    then a modified performance-intensity function must be obtained to
        ;;    determine best performance (see Narrative for description of procedures).
        ;;
        ;;When describing speech recognition performance, use these terms:
        ;;
        ;;     Percent        Correct Description
        ;;     100-94%        Excellent (Normal)
        ;;     92-80%         Good
        ;;     78-70%         Fair
        ;;     Less than 70%  Poor
        ;;
        ;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
        ;;
        ;;    1.  Report middle ear status, confirm type of loss and indicate need
        ;;        for medical follow-up.  In cases where there is poor inter-test
        ;;        reliability and/or positive Stenger test results, obtain and report
        ;;        estimates of hearing thresholds using a combination of behavioral
        ;;        testing, Stenger interference levels, and electrophysiological
        ;;        tests.
        ;;    2.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted
        ;;        in the examination report.
        ;;
        ;;E.  Diagnosis:
        ;;
        ;;    1.  Summary of audiologic test results.  Indicate type and degree 
        ;;        of hearing loss for the frequency range from 500 to 4000 Hz.
        ;;        For type of loss, indicate whether it is normal, conductive,
        ;;        sensorineural, central, or mixed.  For degree, indicate whether
        ;;        it is mild (26-40 HL), moderate (41-54 HL), moderately severe 
        ;;        (55-69 HL), severe (70-89 HL), or profound (90+ HL).
        ;;
        ;;    [For VA purposes, impaired hearing is considered to be a disability
        ;;    when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000,
        ;;    3000, and 4000 Hz is 40 dB HL or greater; or when the auditory thresholds
        ;;    for at least three of these frequencies are 26 dB HL or greater; or when
        ;;    speech recognition scores are less than 94%]
        ;;
        ;;    2.  Note whether, based on audiologic results, medical follow-up
        ;;        is needed for an ear or hearing problem, and whether there is
        ;;        a problem that, if treated, might cause a change in hearing 
        ;;        threshold levels.
        ;;
        ;;    3.  If there is a current complaint of tinnitus, indicate whether or not
        ;;        tinnitus is as likely as not a symptom associated with hearing loss,
        ;;        if hearing loss is present.  If there is no hearing loss present;
        ;;        or the audiologist determines that it is as likely as not that
        ;;        tinnitus is associated with another medical condition; or the
        ;;        etiology of tinnitus cannot be determined on the basis of available
        ;;        information without resorting to speculation, so state.  The VBA
        ;;        regional office will then determine whether further non-audiological
        ;;        examination is needed, based on their review of all evidence of
        ;;        record.

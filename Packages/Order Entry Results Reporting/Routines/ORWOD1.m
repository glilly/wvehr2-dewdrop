        ;;         Quick Orders Which Should be Considered for Editing
        ;;
        ;;CPRS 27 has added three new fields (Route, IV Type, and Schedule) to the
        ;;IV Order Dialog. For all IV orders the Route and IV Type must be defined.
        ;;For Intermittent IV Type orders the schedule field must be defined. CPRS
        ;;will not process the orders unless these fields are defined.
        ;;
        ;;The following table of Quick Orders (QO) was compiled by examining the
        ;;QOs and whether or not they were contained in another entry of the Order
        ;;Dialog file, e.g., Order Menu, Order Set and/or the Reminder Dialog
        ;;file. QOs which are contained in those files should be edited ASAP after
        ;;CPRS v27 is installed. QOs not contained in those files are less critical
        ;;but should still be edited. Note that if the ORCM SEARCH/REPLACE option
        ;;is used, it does not look for usage in the Reminder Dialog file and thus
        ;;may give different results than the table below.
        ;;
        ;;The Quick Orders are listed in alphabetical order by QO name and include
        ;;the QO's IEN (internal reference number), display name, and Legend code.
        ;;The Legend code corresponds to a letter or letters in the Legend (see
        ;;below.) You will need to evaluate each quick order and update it based on
        ;;the Legend code(s).
        ;;
        ;;A Quick Order can be edited by using the "Enter/edit quick orders" option
        ;;on the Order Menu Management menu in VistA (roll and scroll). At the
        ;;prompt, "Select QUICK ORDER NAME:", enter the name of the Quick Order.
        ;;The QO will then be displayed for your editing.  The "Enter/edit quick
        ;;orders" option can also be used to edit a Personal Quick Order.
        ;;
        ;;Additionally, when OR*3.0*301 is released, it will include a new option
        ;;entitled, Convert IV Inpatient QO to Infusion QO [OR CONVERT INP TO QO].
        ;;This option will be on the ORDER MENU MANAGEMENT [ORCM MENU] menu. This
        ;;option enables CACs at sites to convert an IV quick order that is set-up
        ;;as an Inpatient quick order to the new Infusion quick order format. 
        ;;
        ;;QO Edit Hint:
        ;;In addition to entering the QO name, users may also edit a Quick Order by
        ;;entering the back tick (`) and the IEN at the "Select QUICK ORDER NAME:"
        ;;prompt. For example, if the Quick Order name is PSI SICU CAM DOBUTAMINE 500
        ;;MG and the IEN is 6200, a user may enter "`6200" at the "Select QUICK ORDER
        ;;NAME:" prompt. This will save the time required to type the name of the Quick
        ;;Order in at the "Select QUICK ORDER NAME:" prompt.
        ;;
        ;;Note: The term 'null', as used below, can be viewed as meaning 'not defined'.
        ;;
        ;;Legend:
        ;;A...Problem: The IV type is null or the route is null.
        ;;    Action:  Please edit the IV Type or route fields with the appropriate
        ;;      information.
        ;;B...Problem: The IV type is 'I' and the schedule is null.
        ;;    Action:  For Intermittent IV Orders a schedule is needed to process the
        ;;      order.  Enter a schedule which denotes the Intermittent IV dose.
        ;;C...Problem: Continuous IV Type does not have a rate defined. When accepting
        ;;      the order in CPRS, rate is required and must be between 1 and 9999.9,
        ;;      a whole number, or text that contains an '@'. Some continuous IV Type
        ;;      Quick Orders may not include a rate to allow provider to define at
        ;;      time of order.
        ;;    Action:  Evaluate need for rate default and assign in Quick Order if
        ;;      appropriate. The infusion rate must be a number up to four digits and
        ;;      it will allow up to one decimal place. If IV Type is not defined in
        ;;      the Quick Order, then an IV Type must be defined in the Quick Order
        ;;      set-up.
        ;;D...Problem:  The IV type is 'I' but the rate is not a whole number minute
        ;;      or hour yet not null.
        ;;    Action:  A valid "Infuse Over" value must be assigned to the Quick
        ;;      Order. Using the Quick Order Editor, add an "Infuse Over" value in
        ;;      the number of minutes (maximum of 9999).
        ;;E...Problem:  The IV limit or duration (limitation) value was other than
        ;;      null or a whole number.
        ;;    Action:  This field is not required but if it exists, it must be a
        ;;      whole number. To correct this, follow the Help Text for the Limitation
        ;;      Prompt in the Quick Order editor for this Quick Order.
        ;;F...Problem:  The Order Dialogs with 'MM' in the display text
        ;;    Action:  MMOL (millimole) has been added as a unit of measure.  Please 
        ;;      replace 'MM' with MMOL.
        ;;G...Problem:  Auto Accept Quick Order which was 'Y'es and now set to 'N'o.
        ;;    Action:  These Quick Orders were converted from an Auto Accept Quick
        ;;      Order to a non-Auto Accept Quick because they have at least one
        ;;      invalid field. Please correct the problems identified by the Legend
        ;;      code(s) for the Quick Order before setting the Quick Order back to
        ;;      an Auto-Accept Quick Order.
        ;;
        ;;Note: QO Names and QO Display Names over 30 characters are truncated at 30
        ;;      characters.  If in doubt on the Name you can use the IEN to edit the
        ;;      Quick Order (see above).

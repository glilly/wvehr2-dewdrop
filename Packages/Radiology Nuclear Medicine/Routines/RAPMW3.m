        ;;1. Cancelled, "No Credit", inpatient cases, and not the highest modality
        ;;   of a printset are excluded from this report.  (See 3. below.)
        ;;
        ;;2. Columns represent # of days wait from the Registered date (the date/
        ;;   time entered at the "Imaging Exam Date/Time:" prompt) backwards to the
        ;;   Date Desired for the ordered procedure.  The calculation is based on
        ;;   the number of different days and not rounded off by hours.  The "31-60"
        ;;   column represents those orders that were registered 31 days or more but
        ;;   less than 61 days after the Date Desired.
        ;;
        ;;3. If the user did not select a specific CPT Code or Procedure Name, 
        ;;   then the cases from a printset (group of cases that share the same
        ;;   report) will have only the case with the highest modality printed.  
        ;;   The modalities have this hierarchical order, where (1) is the highest:
        ;;   (1) Interventional, (2) MRI, (3) CT, (4) Cardiac Stress test, 
        ;;   (5) Nuc Med, (6) US, (7) Mammo, (8) General Rad (9) Other
        ;;
        ;;4. "Procedure Types" are assigned by a national CPT code look-up table
        ;;   and may differ from locally defined "Imaging Types."  Therefore the
        ;;   number of procedures in each category may not be the same as other
        ;;   radiology management reports.
        ;;
        ;;5. "Avg. Days" is the average days wait.  It is calculated from the sum
        ;;   of the days wait for that Procedure Type, divided by the count of cases
        ;;   included in this report for that Procedure Type.  Negative days wait
        ;;   is counted as 0.  A "-" means an average cannot be calculated.
        ;;
        ;;6. Procedure Type of "unknown" refers to either cases that have no 
        ;;   matching procedure type in the spreadsheet of CPT Codes provided
        ;;   by the Office of Patient Care Services, or cases that are missing
        ;;   data for the procedure.
        ;;
        ;
DAY14   ;
        ;;   The "<=14 Days" column contains data that is also in the "<=30
        ;;   Days" column. The reason that performance is calculated for both
        ;;   <=14 days and <=30 days is so that facilities can track their
        ;;   performance to a 14 day performance standard rather than a 30
        ;;   day standard if they choose to do so.

 ;;A. Review of Medical Records:
 ;;
 ;;B. Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
 ;;    Comment on:
 ;;
 ;;    1. Activity of pulmonary tuberculosis or other mycobacterial disease. 
 ;;    2. Date of inactivity if it is not active.
 ;;    3. Identity of organism (if possible).
 ;;
 ;;C. Physical examination (Objective Findings):
 ;;    Address each of the following and fully describe current findings:
 ;;
 ;;    1. Extent of structural damage to lungs.
 ;;    2. If patient was hospitalized for 6 months or more, what is the
 ;;       condition at the end of hospitalization?
 ;;    3. If patient was hospitalized for 12 months or more, what is the
 ;;        condition at the end of hospitalization?
 ;;
 ;;D. Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
 ;;Provide:
 ;;
 ;;1. Pulmonary Function Tests, if indicated. If performed, include the results
 ;;   in the examination report, The FEV-1,FVC, and FEV-1/FVC should be included.
 ;;   Both pre- and post-bronchodilatation pulmonary function test results should
 ;;   be reported. If post-bronchodilatation test is not conducted in a particular
 ;;   case, please provide an explanation of why not. A DLCO may or may not be
 ;;   done routinely as part of pulmonary function testing at a particular
 ;;   facility. If there is a disparity between the results of different tests,
 ;;   please indicate which tests are more likely to accurately reflect
 ;;   the severity of the condition.
 ;;
 ;;      DLCO note: If DLCO was not done as a routine part of pulmonary function
 ;;      testing, the examiner should use his or her judgment, based on
 ;;      the specific condition (.e.g., whether it is obstructive,
 ;;      interstitial, etc.) and other available information about the condition,
 ;;      as to whether a DLCO test is needed, since it is not useful in all
 ;;      situations. If it may provide useful information about the severity
 ;;      of the condition, it should be requested and reviewed before
 ;;      the examination report is submitted. If the examiner determines that
 ;;      the DLCO test is not needed, a statement as to why not (e.g., there are
 ;;      decreased lung volumes that would not yield valid test results) should be
 ;;      included in the report. Such a statement could avoid a remand from BVA
 ;;      when the test is not done. However in the case of a BVA remand in which
 ;;      the DLCO is requested, the DLCO MUST be done unless there is a medical
 ;;      contraindication.
 ;;
 ;;E. Diagnosis:
 ;;
 ;;      1. In reactivated cases, is this reactivation of the old disease
 ;;         or a separate and distinct new infection?
 ;;
 ;;ADDITIONAL NOTE TO THE EXAMINER:
 ;;
 ;;In all claims, if the disease is inactive and if the inactivity was confirmed
 ;;at a non-VA facility, obtain the name and mailing address of the facility
 ;;from the veteran so that the Regional Office may request the report.

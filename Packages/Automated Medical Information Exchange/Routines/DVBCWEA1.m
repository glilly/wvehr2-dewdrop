 ;;
 ;;     a. Describe fully.
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;C. Examination (Objective Findings):
 ;;
 ;;   Address each of the following and fully describe:
 ;;   1. Mental status exam to confirm or establish diagnosis in 
 ;;      accordance with DSM-IV.
 ;; 
 ;;   2. Additionally, please provide this specific information.

 ;; 
 ;; 
 ;;      b. Expected minimum weight based on age, height, and body build.

 ;;D. Diagnostic Tests (including psychological testing if deemed necessary):
 ;; 
 ;;   1. Provide specific evaluation information required by the rating 
 ;;      board or on a BVA Remand. Diagnostic Tests (See the examination
 ;;      request remarks for specifics.):
 ;; 
 ;;      a.  COMPETENCY: State whether the veteran is capable of managing
 ;;          his or her benefit payments in the individual's own best 
 ;;          interests.  (A physical disability which prevents the veteran
 ;;          from attending to financial matters in person is not a proper 
 ;;          basis for a finding of incompetency unless the veteran is, 
 ;;          by reason of that disability, incapable of directing someone
 ;;          else in handling the individual's financial affairs.)
 ;;
 ;;TOF 
 ;;      b.  OTHER OPINION: Furnish any other specific opinion requested
 ;;          by the rating board or BVA Remand, furnishing the complete 
 ;;          rationale and citation of medical texts or treatise supporting 
 ;;          opinion, if medical literature review was undertaken. If the
 ;;          requested opinion is medically not ascertainable on exam or
 ;;          testing, please state WHY. If the requested opinion cannot 
 ;;          be expressed without resorting to speculation or making 
 ;;          improbable assumptions say so, and explain why. If the opinion 
 ;;          asks "...is it at least as likely as not...", fully explain
 ;;          the clinical findings and rationale for the opinion.
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;  2.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted 
 ;;      in the examination report.

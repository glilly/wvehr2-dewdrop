 ;;
 ;;           a. CAPACITY TO MANAGE FINANCIAL AFFAIRS Mental competency, for
 ;;           VA benefits purposes, refers only to the ability of the veteran
 ;;           to manage VA benefit payments in his or her own best interest,
 ;;           and not to any other subject. Mental incompetence, for VA benefits
 ;;           purposes, means that the veteran, because of injury or disease,
 ;;           is not capable of managing benefit payments in his or her best
 ;;           interest. In order to assist raters in making a legal determination
 ;;           as to competency, please address the following:
 ;;             - What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability
 ;;               to manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration
 ;;               of such things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit
 ;;               payment, knowing the amounts and types of bills owed monthly,
 ;;               and handling the payment prudently? Does the veteran handle
 ;;               the money and pay the bills?
 ;;
 ;;             - Based on your examination, do you believe that the veteran is
 ;;               capable of managing his or her financial affairs?
 ;;             - Please provide examples to support your conclusion.
 ;;
 ;;               If you believe a Social Work Service assessment is needed before
 ;;               you can give your opinion on the veteran's ability to manage his
 ;;               or her financial affairs, please explain why.
 ;;
 ;;           b. Other Opinion: Furnish any other specific opinion requested 
 ;;              by the rating board or BVA Remand furnishing the complete
 ;;              rationale and citation of medical texts or treatise supporting
 ;;              opinion, if medical literature review was undertaken.
 ;;              If the requested opinion is medically not ascertainable on exam
 ;;              or testing, please indicate why. If the requested opinion cannot
 ;;              be expressed without resorting to speculation or making improbable
 ;;              assumptions say so, and explain why. If the opinion asks "...is it
 ;;              at least as likely as not..?", fully explain the clinical findings
 ;;              and rationale for the opinion.
 ;;
 ;;     4. Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted
 ;;        in the examination report.

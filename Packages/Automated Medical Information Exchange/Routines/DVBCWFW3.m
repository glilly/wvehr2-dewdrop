 ;;A.  Review of Medical Records:
 ;;
 ;;B.  Medical History (Subjective Complaints):
 ;;
 ;;    Comment on:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Pain, weakness, stiffness, swelling, heat, redness, 
 ;;        fatigability, lack of endurance, etc.
 ;;    2.  Describe symptoms at rest and on standing and walking.
 ;;    3.  Treatment - type, dose, frequency, response, side effects.
 ;;    4.  If there are periods of flare-up of joint disease:
 ;;
 ;;        a.  State their severity, frequency, and duration.
 ;;        b.  Name the precipitating and alleviating factors.
 ;;        c.  Estimate to what extent, if any, they result in additional
 ;;            limitation of motion or functional impairment during the 
 ;;            flare-up. (Per veteran)
 ;;
 ;;
 ;;    5.  Describe whether crutches, brace, cane, corrective shoes, 
 ;;        shoe inserts, etc., are needed and their efficacy.
 ;;    6.  History of any hospitalization or surgery (Date, location, if known,
 ;;        reason or type of surgery).
 ;;    7.  Describe effects of the condition(s) on the veteran's usual 
 ;;        occupation and daily activities.
 ;;    8.  Describe any injury to the feet.
 ;;    9.  Functional limitations on standing (i.e., unable to stand, able
 ;;        to stand 15-30 minutes) and walking (i.e., nonambulatory, able to
 ;;        walk 1/4 mile).
 ;;    10. History of neoplasm:
 ;;
 ;;        a. Date of diagnosis, diagnosis.
 ;;        b. Benign or malignant.
 ;;        c. Types and dates of treatment.
 ;;        d. Date of last treatment.
 ;;
 ;;C.  Physical Examination (Objective Findings):
 ;;
 ;;    Address each of the following as appropriate to the condition 
 ;;    being examined and fully describe current findings:  A DETAILED 
 ;;    ASSESSMENT OF EACH AFFECTED JOINT IS REQUIRED.
 ;;
 ;;    1.  Describe each foot separately.  For nomenclature of toes use:
 ;;        great toe, second, third, fourth, and fifth.  The functional 
 ;;        loss should be related to the anatomical condition.
 ;;    2.  Describe objective evidence of painful motion, edema, 
 ;;        instability, weakness, tenderness, etc.
 ;;    3.  Describe gait.
 ;;    4.  Describe any callosities, breakdown, or unusual shoe wear 
 ;;        pattern that would indicate abnormal weight bearing.
 ;;    5.  Describe any skin and vascular changes.
 ;;    6.  Describe hammertoes, high arch, clawfoot, or other deformity -
 ;;        actively or passively correctable?
 ;;    7.  For flatfoot
 ;;
 ;;        a.  Describe weight bearing and non-weight bearing alignment 
 ;;            of the Achilles tendon.
 ;;        b.  Describe whether the Achilles tendon alignment can be 
 ;;            corrected by manipulation and whether there is pain on 
 ;;            manipulation.
 ;;        c.  Describe degrees of valgus and whether correctable by 
 ;;            manipulation.
 ;;        d.  Describe extent of forefoot and midfoot malalignment and 
 ;;            whether correctable by manipulation.
 ;;
 ;;    8.  For hallux valgus, describe angulation and dorsiflexion at 
 ;;        first metatarsal phalangeal joints.
 ;;    9.  Is there any active motion in the metatarsophalangeal joint of
 ;;        the great toe?  
 ;;
 ;;D.  Diagnostic and Clinical Tests:
 ;;
 ;;    Comment on:
 ;;
 ;;    1.  X-rays for flatfoot and clawfoot - weight bearing AP and 
 ;;        lateral views and non-weight bearing AP, lateral, and oblique
 ;;        views, if none are of record or if of record and condition has or
 ;;        may have progressed.
 ;;    2.  For other conditions, AP, lateral, and oblique of entire foot,
 ;;        as applicable.
 ;;    3.  Include results of all diagnostic and clinical tests conducted
 ;;        in the examination report.

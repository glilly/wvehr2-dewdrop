 Q
 ;
 ; Deal with impossible errors (errors which should never occur,
 ; and which weren't already trapped by M).
 ;
IMPOSS(UETYPE,UEOPT,UEMSG,UEMSG2,UELOC,UEROU,UENOLOG) ;EP - deal with impossible errors - called from many places
 ; $$IMPOSS^BPSOSUE(UETYPE,UEOPT,UEMSG,UELOC,UEROU)
 ; UETYPE = kinds of problems which may have occured
 ;     ["FM" a Fileman call has returned an error
 ;     ["L"  a LOCK with ample time has failed
 ;     ["DB" a database error (some missing/incorrect field) 
 ;     ["P"  a programming error / some unexpected condition
 ;     ["DEV" some kind of device or file error
 ; UEOPT = options available; first one listed is the default
 ;     Defaults to "TRI"
 ;     ["R" retry - retry the operation; log err
 ;     ["I" ignore - continue as though operation had succeeded; log err
 ;     ["T" abort - log err and terminate
 ; UEMSG = optionally, an additional message to output
 ;    can be .MSG, and we'll walk the array for you.
 ; UEMSG2 = even more message, like UEMSG.  In a Fileman call failure,
 ;    you'd probably send   .FDA,.MSG
 ; UELOC = location, any number or name unique to the calling routine
 ; UEROU = the name of the calling routine
 ; UENOLOG = true if you do not want error log entry to be made
 ;
 ; $$ returns 1 to retry, 0 to ignore
 ;
 ; Caller may do with these values what he desires.
 ;
 ; To prevent excessive errors, we won't actually log an error if
 ; another one has been logged recently.
 ;
 ; This routine really isn't as important as it looks.   In fact,
 ; it will almost never be encountered in practice.  Its existence
 ; owes mostly to an outrageous ruling made in the name of,
 ; but contrary to, the very quality and maintainability that forced
 ; errors give you.  This in turn led to a significant delay 
 ; in the release of a product which has been proven to be dependable
 ; in practice. 
 ;
 ; Formerly, a zero/zero forced error was found at various places 
 ; in the code.  In 13 months at ANMC, 11 months at Sitka, 
 ; and several months at Pawhuska, Wewoka, Santa Fe, and Taos, the
 ; zero div by zero traps were never encountered, but over $3,000,000
 ; in revenues were collected.  The ironic thing is,
 ; without those extra checking, of things like Fileman return values,
 ; sanity checks on input values, etc., the product would have been
 ; less reliable, yet it would have sailed through the verifiction
 ; phase of the project plan.
 ;
 ; Forced errors already pervade all of the M language.  <UNDEF> is
 ; a forced error, for example.  And forced errors are an integral part
 ; of the design of the very hardware that runs these programs.
 ; Follow the anti-forced error policy to its logical end and you
 ; go to Intersleaze and say "stop issuing <UNDEF> and instead,
 ; prompt the user for the opportunity to continue" and then you go
 ; to Intel and say "remove the addressing exception trap from your
 ; microcode; our support organization wouldn't be able to cope with
 ; the problem report on something like that."
